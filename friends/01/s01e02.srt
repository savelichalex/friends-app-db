1
00:00:02,878 --> 00:00:04,296
What you guys don't understand is...

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,549
...for us, kissing is as important
as any part of it.

3
00:00:07,925 --> 00:00:09,510
Yeah, right.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,096
You serious?

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:15,098
Oh, yeah.

6
00:00:15,307 --> 00:00:17,684
Everything you need to know
is in that first kiss.

7
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:19,770
-Absolutely.
-Yeah, I think, for us...

8
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:22,022
...kissing is pretty much
like an opening act.

9
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:24,775
I mean, it's like the stand-up comedian
you have to sit through...

10
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:27,110
...before Pink Floyd comes out.

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,700
Yeah, and it's not that
we don't like the comedian.

12
00:00:33,909 --> 00:00:37,079
It's just that that's not...

13
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,289
...why we bought the ticket.

14
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:42,209
See, the problem is, though...

15
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:45,003
...after the concert's over,
no matter how great the show was...

16
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:48,674
...you girls are always looking
for the comedian again.

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,884
I mean, we're in the car,
we're fighting traffic...

18
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,845
...basically just trying to stay awake.

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,934
Yeah, well, word of advice:
Bring back the comedian.

20
00:00:59,142 --> 00:01:00,894
Otherwise, you're gonna find yourself...

21
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,689
...sitting at home
listening to that album alone.

22
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,779
Are we still talking about sex?

23
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:07,210
ROSS:
No, it's good. It is good.

24
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:11,089
It's just that,
doesn't she seem a little angry?

25
00:02:11,298 --> 00:02:13,008
Well, she has issues.

26
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,219
Does she?

27
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,638
He's out banging other women
over the head with a club...

28
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:22,684
...while she sits at home trying to get
the mastodon smell out of the carpet.

29
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,979
Marsha, see, these are cave people.

30
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,358
Okay, they have issues like:

31
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:33,570
"Gee, that glacier's getting kind of close."
See?

32
00:02:33,779 --> 00:02:35,864
Speaking of issues,
isn't that your ex-wife?

33
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:38,742
-No, no.
-Yes, it is. Carol, hi.

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,494
ROSS:
Okay. Yes. Yes, it is.

35
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,080
How about I'll catch up with you
in the Ice Age?

36
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,763
-Hi.
-Hi.

37
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:08,522
So....

38
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,191
You look great.

39
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,068
I hate that.

40
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,364
Sorry. Thanks. You look good too.

41
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,492
Well, you know, in here, anyone who...

42
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:23,328
...stands erect....

43
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,625
-So, what's new? Still a-
-A lesbian?

44
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:30,419
Well....

45
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,963
You never know.

46
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,215
How's, urn-? How's the family?

47
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,801
Marty's still totally paranoid.

48
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,096
-Oh, and-
-Carol, why are you here, Carol?

49
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:45,225
-I'm pregnant.
-Pregnant.

50
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:56,236
<i>Oh. Looks like she didn't leave
in such a hurry after all.</i>

51
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,697
I think this is the episode
of <i>Three's Company...</i>

52
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,199
...where's there's some kind
of misunderstanding.

53
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:06,538
Then I've already seen this one.

54
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,000
Are you through with that? Thanks.

55
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,627
Yeah, sorry, the swallowing
slowed me down.

56
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:15,922
Whose little ball of paper is this?

57
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:17,174
Oh, that would be mine.

58
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:19,843
See, I wrote a note to myself,
then I didn't need it.

59
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,262
So I balled it up
and now I wish I was dead.

60
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,726
She already fluffed that pillow.
Monica, you know, you already fluffed-

61
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,770
But it's fine.

62
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,188
Look, I'm sorry.

63
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,857
I don't want to give them
any more ammunition than they have.

64
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,942
Yes, we know how cruel
a parent can be...

65
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,279
...about the flatness of a child's pillow.

66
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:42,282
Monica? Hi. Urn....

67
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,327
Monica, um, you're scaring me.

68
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,248
I mean, you're, like, all chaotic
and twirly, you know?

69
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:51,666
Not in a good way.

70
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,711
Yeah, calm down.

71
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,216
You don't see Ross getting all chaotic
and twirly every time they come.

72
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:03,303
That's because, as far as my parents are
concerned, Ross can do no wrong.

73
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:05,555
You see, he's the prince.

74
00:05:05,764 --> 00:05:09,142
Apparently they had some big ceremony
before I was born.

75
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,562
Ew, ew, ew.

76
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,440
-What?
-Ugly Naked Guy got a ThighMaster.

77
00:05:18,068 --> 00:05:19,528
Ew.

78
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:23,323
-Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
-Yeah, it's beautiful.

79
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,372
Oh, God. Oh, God.

80
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,042
-Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
-No, don't touch that.

81
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:40,715
Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough
having to give it back to him.

82
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,717
"Hi, Barry, remember me? I'm the girl...

83
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:46,096
...that stomped on your heart
in front of your entire family"

84
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:49,641
Oh, God. Now I'm gonna have to
return the ring, without the ring...

85
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:52,727
...which makes it so much harder.

86
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,564
Easy, Rach, we'll find it. Won't we?

87
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,482
-Oh, yeah.
MONICA: Okay, look.

88
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,695
When did you have it on last?

89
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,239
Doy. Probably right before she lost it.

90
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,244
You don't get a lot of "doy" these days.

91
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,707
I know I had it this morning.

92
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,793
I know I had it when I was
in the kitchen with....

93
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,628
Dinah?

94
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,050
Oh, don't be mad.

95
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,887
-You didn't.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,389
I gave you one job.

97
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,685
Oh, but look how straight
those noodles are.

98
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:38,523
Monica, you know that's not how you look
for an engagement ring in a lasagna.

99
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,611
I just can't do it.

100
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:45,155
Boys?

101
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,699
We're going in.

102
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,417
Hi.

103
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,545
Oh, that is not a happy "hi."

104
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:02,255
Carol's pregnant.

105
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,049
Oh, I found it.

106
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,304
Well, what-? What...?

107
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,056
Yeah.

108
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,350
Do that for another two hours...

109
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,561
...you might be where I am
right about now.

110
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,815
Kind of puts that whole pillow thing
in perspective, huh, Mon?

111
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:25,153
Well, now, how do you fit
into this whole thing?

112
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,448
Well, Carol says she and Susan
want me to be involved.

113
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:33,286
But if I'm not comfortable with it,
I don't have to be involved.

114
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,497
Basically, it's totally up to me.

115
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,916
She is so great. I miss her.

116
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,547
What does she mean by "involved"?

117
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:47,342
I mean, presumably,
the biggest part of your job is done.

118
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,180
Anyway, they want me
to go down to this...

119
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:54,808
...sonogram thing with them tomorrow.

120
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,059
So, what are you gonna do?

121
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:58,311
I have no idea.

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,148
No matter what I do, though,
I'm still gonna be a father.

123
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,910
Well, this is still ruined, right?

124
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,837
Oh. Martha Lugwin's daughter
is gonna call you.

125
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,383
Mm. What's that curry taste?

126
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,135
Curry.

127
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,804
Mm.

128
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,559
I think they're great. I really do.

129
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:38,727
You remember the Lugwins?

130
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,812
The big one had a thing for you,
didn't she?

131
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,772
They all had a thing for him.

132
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,733
Oh, Mom.

133
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,027
I'm sorry.
Why is this girl going to call me?

134
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:51,740
Oh, she just graduated, and she wants
to be something in cooking or food...

135
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,074
...or I don't know.

136
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,660
Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant,
so-

137
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,538
No, Mom. I don't have a restaurant.
I work in a restaurant.

138
00:08:58,747 --> 00:09:01,416
Well, they don't have to know that.

139
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,963
Ross, could you come and help me
with the spaghetti.

140
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,131
Yes.

141
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,592
Oh, we're having spaghetti. That's...

142
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,260
...easy.

143
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:17,348
I know this is going to sound
unbelievably selfish on my part...

144
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:20,769
...but were you planning on bringing
up the whole baby/lesbian thing?

145
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,688
Because I think it might take
some of the heat off me.

146
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,653
What that Rachel did to her life.
We ran into her parents at the club.

147
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,822
They were not playing very well.

148
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:35,283
I'm not gonna tell you
what they spent on that wedding...

149
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:38,036
...but $40,000 is a lot of money.

150
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,667
Well, at least she had the chance
to leave a man at the altar.

151
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,590
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

152
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,094
-It's an expression.
-No, it's not.

153
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,470
Don't listen to your mother.

154
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,639
You're independent
and you always have been.

155
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,308
Even when you were a kid,
and you were chubby...

156
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:03,353
...and you had no friends,
you were just fine.

157
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:08,274
You'd read alone in your room.
And your puzzles....

158
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,782
Look, there are people, like Ross,
who need to shoot for the stars.

159
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:18,827
With his museum and his papers
getting published.

160
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,287
Other people are satisfied
with staying where they are.

161
00:10:21,496 --> 00:10:25,166
I'm telling you, these are the people
who never get cancer.

162
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:32,215
And I read about these women
trying to have it all, and I thank God...

163
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,426
...our little Harmonica
doesn't seem to have that problem.

164
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,849
So, Ross, what's going on with you?

165
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,979
Any stories? No news, no little
anecdotes to share with the folks?

166
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:47,272
Okay, okay.

167
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:54,028
Ahem. Look, I, uh- I realize you guys
have been wondering...

168
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,865
...what exactly happened
between Carol and me.

169
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,867
And so, well, here's the deal.

170
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:03,371
Carol's a lesbian.

171
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,876
She's living with a woman named Susan.

172
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:12,922
She's pregnant with my child.

173
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,467
And she and Susan
are going to raise the baby.

174
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,181
And you knew about this?

175
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,656
Your folks are really that bad, huh?

176
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,327
Well, you know, these people are pros.

177
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:47,165
They know what they're doing.
They take their time.

178
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,043
They get the job done.

179
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,006
Boy, I know they say that
you can't change your parents.

180
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,343
Boy, if you could, I'd want yours.

181
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:01,930
Must pee.

182
00:12:03,014 --> 00:12:04,766
You know, it's even worse
when you're twins.

183
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,143
-You're a twin?
-Oh, yeah. We don't speak.

184
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:10,146
She's like this high-powered,
driven, career-type.

185
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,315
-What does she do?
-She's a waitress.

186
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:17,528
All right. You guys,
I kind of gotta clean up now.

187
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:20,615
Chandler, you're an only child, right?
You don't have any of this.

188
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:24,160
Well, no, although I did
have an imaginary friend...

189
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,246
...who my parents actually preferred.

190
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,583
RACHEL:
Hit the lights, please.

191
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,925
How long was I in there?

192
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:41,886
I'm just cleaning up.

193
00:12:42,637 --> 00:12:45,473
Oh, do you, uh-?
Do you need any help?

194
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,351
Um, okay, sure. Thanks.

195
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,692
Anyway....

196
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:59,195
So you nervous about Barry tomorrow?

197
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,156
-Oh, a little.
-Mm-hm.

198
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,201
-A lot.
-Mm-hm.

199
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,454
So got any advice?

200
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,749
You know, as someone
who's recently been dumped.

201
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,462
Well, you may want to steer clear
of the word "dumped."

202
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:22,093
Chances are he's going to be this
broken shell of a man. You know?

203
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:26,347
So you should try not to look too terrific.
I know it'll be hard.

204
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:34,230
Or, you know, hey, I'll go down there,
and I'll give Barry back his ring.

205
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:38,776
And you can go with Carol
and Susan to the OB-GYN.

206
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:43,489
You've got Carol tomorrow.

207
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,284
When did it get so complicated?

208
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,785
Got me.

209
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,080
-Remember when we were in high school?
-Yeah.

210
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,791
I mean, didn't you think
you' were gonna meet someone...

211
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,544
...fall in love, and that'd be it?

212
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,509
-Ross?
-Yes, yes.

213
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:08,806
Oh. Man. I never thought I'd be here.

214
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,399
Me neither.

215
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,877
Hi. Sorry I'm late. I got stuck at work.

216
00:14:38,086 --> 00:14:41,547
There was this big
dinosaur thing. Anyway....

217
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,175
Hi.

218
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,887
-Ross, you remember Susan.
-How could I forget?

219
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,263
Ross.

220
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,100
Hello, Susan. Good shake, good shake.

221
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:56,729
So, uh, we're just waiting for...?

222
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,232
-Dr. Oberman.
-Dr. Oberman. Okay, and is he-?

223
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,984
-She.
-Of course, "she."

224
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:07,198
She, uh, familiar
with our special situation?

225
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,242
Yes, and she's very supportive.

226
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,536
Great. Okay, that's great. Heh.

227
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,705
No, I'm....

228
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:17,166
CAROL:
Thanks.

229
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:32,890
Quack, quack...

230
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:35,101
...quack, quack, quack.

231
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,978
Ross?

232
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,938
That opens my cervix.

233
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:48,281
-Barry?
BARRY: Come on in.

234
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,449
Are you sure?

235
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:52,118
BARRY: It's fine, it's fine.
Robbie's gonna be here for hours.

236
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,494
Huh?

237
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,416
So how are you doing?

238
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,252
I'm....

239
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,754
I'm okay.

240
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,798
You look great.

241
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,258
Yeah, well....

242
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:10,636
<i>Dr. Farber, Jason Greenspan's gagging.</i>

243
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:13,598
Be right there. I'll be back in a second.

244
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,188
I dumped him.

245
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,815
Okay.

246
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,575
Oh!

247
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:42,126
-Ross.
-So, um-? So how's this going to work...

248
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,920
...ahem, you know, with us?

249
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,048
You know, when, like, important
decisions have to be made?

250
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,716
Give me a "for instance."

251
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,593
Well, I don't know. Okay, okay.

252
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,137
-How about with the baby's name?
-Marlon...

253
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,183
-Marlon.
-...if it's a boy. Minnie, if it's a girl.

254
00:16:59,268 --> 00:17:00,895
As in "Mouse"?

255
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,814
As in my grandmother.

256
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,735
Still, you say "Minnie,"
you hear "Mouse."

257
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,405
How about, urn....

258
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,491
How about "Julia"?

259
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,409
Julia.

260
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:16,786
We agreed on Minnie.

261
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:19,747
It's funny, um, we agreed
we'd spend our lives together.

262
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,792
Things change. Roll with the punches.

263
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,253
I believe Julia's on the table.

264
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:29,715
Oh. Sorry about that.

265
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,346
So, what have you been up to?

266
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,391
Oh. Not much.

267
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,394
-I got a job.
-Hey, that's great.

268
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,938
Why are you so tan?

269
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,190
Oh, I, uh....

270
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,651
I went to Aruba.

271
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,779
Oh, no.
You went on our honeymoon alone?

272
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:53,489
No.

273
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:58,494
See, uh, I went with....

274
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:01,414
-Now, this may hurt.
-Me?

275
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,873
No.

276
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,961
I went with Mindy.

277
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,463
Mindy?

278
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,716
My maid of honor, Mindy?

279
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:14,594
Yeah, well, we're kind of a thing now.

280
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,014
Well, I'm....

281
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,975
You got plugs.

282
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:24,020
Careful, careful.
They haven't quite taken yet.

283
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,981
And you got lenses.

284
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,900
But you hate sticking
your finger in your eye.

285
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,819
Not for her.

286
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:34,071
Oh.

287
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,075
Listen, I really wanted to thank you.

288
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,161
Okay.

289
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,997
About a month ago, I wanted to hurt you...

290
00:18:43,414 --> 00:18:45,791
...more than I've ever
wanted to hurt anyone in my life.

291
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,418
And I'm an orthodontist.

292
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,712
Wow.

293
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,507
You know, you were right.
I mean, I thought we were happy.

294
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,759
We weren't happy.

295
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:58,262
But with Mindy...

296
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,848
...now I'm happy.

297
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:03,309
-Spit.
-What?

298
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,269
Me.

299
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,482
Anyway, urn....

300
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,861
I guess, uh- I guess this belongs to you.

301
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,490
And thank you for giving it to me.

302
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,534
Well, thank you for giving it back.

303
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,748
Hello.

304
00:19:29,043 --> 00:19:31,087
Oh, please. What's wrong with Helen?

305
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,421
Helen Geller?

306
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:37,218
-I don't think so.
-Hello, it's not gonna be Helen Geller.

307
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,803
Thank you.

308
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,763
No. I mean, it's not Geller.

309
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,057
What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?

310
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:48,938
No, actually, um, we talked about
Helen Willick Bunch.

311
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,775
Well, wait a minute.
Why is she in the title?

312
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,360
Because it's my baby too.

313
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,863
That's funny. Really? I don't remember
you making any sperm.

314
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,160
And we all know what
a challenge that is.

315
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,204
-Uh-huh. See?
-All right, you two, stop it.

316
00:20:05,413 --> 00:20:07,748
No, no. she gets a credit.
Hey, I'm in there too.

317
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,919
Honestly. You're not actually suggesting
Helen Willick Bunch Geller.

318
00:20:12,128 --> 00:20:13,712
I think that borders on child abuse.

319
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:17,716
Of course not.
I'm suggesting Geller Willick Bunch.

320
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:20,386
Oh, no. No, no, no.
You see what he's doing?

321
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,430
He knows no one
is gonna say all those names.

322
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,266
He knows they'll wind up calling her Geller.
Then he gets his way.

323
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,685
My way? You think this is my way?

324
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,439
Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined
this moment in my life being...

325
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,859
...this is not my way. You know what?
This is too hard.

326
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,070
Knock, knock.
How are we today? Any nausea?

327
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,156
-A little.
-Just a little.

328
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:46,579
Well, I was just wondering about the
mother-to-be, but, uh, thanks for sharing.

329
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,872
Uh, lie back.

330
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,291
You know what? I'm gonna go.

331
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,503
Um, I don't think I can be involved
in this particular family thing.

332
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,349
Oh, my God.

333
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:08,642
Look at that.

334
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:10,311
I know.

335
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,365
Well, isn't that amazing?

336
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,496
What are we supposed
to be seeing here?

337
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:34,210
I don't know, but I think it's about
to attack the <i>Enterprise.</i>

338
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,175
You know, if you tilt your head
to the left and relax your eyes...

339
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,636
...it kind of looks like an old potato.

340
00:21:44,762 --> 00:21:47,056
Then don't do that, all right?

341
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:50,476
Monica?

342
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,228
What do you think?

343
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,896
Mm-hm.

344
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,524
Are you welling up?

345
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:57,983
-No.
-You are.

346
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,444
-You are. You're welling up.
-No, I'm not.

347
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:03,781
-You're gonna be an aunt.
-Oh, shut up.

348
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,408
Hi, Mindy.

349
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:08,702
Hi, it's Rachel.

350
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:12,706
Yeah, I'm fine. I saw Barry today.

351
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:14,583
Oh, yeah, yeah, he told me.

352
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,503
No, it's okay. Really, it's okay.

353
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,382
I hope you two are very happy.
I really do.

354
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,760
And, Min, you know,
if everything works out...

355
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:29,098
...and you guys end up getting
married and having kids and everything...

356
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:32,685
...I just hope they have his
old hairline and your old nose.

357
00:22:37,731 --> 00:22:40,985
Okay, I know it was a cheap shot,
but I feel so much better now.
