1
00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:04,880
Would you let it go?
It's not a big deal.

2
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,882
ROSS: Not a big deal?
It's amazing.

3
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,010
You just reach in, there's one
little maneuver, and bam!

4
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:12,429
A bra. Right out the sleeve.

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:14,181
As far as I'm concerned...

6
00:00:14,431 --> 00:00:17,684
...there is nothing a guy can do
that comes close. Right?

7
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:20,896
Come on!
You guys can pee standing up.

8
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,357
We can? Okay, I'm trying that.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,693
You know what blows my mind?

10
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,155
Women can see breasts
anytime they want.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:34,534
You just look down,
and there they are.

12
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:37,287
How you get any work done
is beyond me.

13
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,292
What I don't get is the way
guys can do so many mean things...

14
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:43,919
...and then not even care.

15
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,928
Multiple orgasms!

16
00:01:48,734 --> 00:01:50,527
So Saturday night, the big night.

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,905
Date night!
Saturday night. Saturday night!

18
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,285
-No plans, huh?
-Not a one.

19
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:01,330
Not even, say,
breaking up with Janice?

20
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,832
Oh, right, right. Shut up.

21
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,462
Chandler, nobody likes
breaking up with someone.

22
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:12,299
-You just gotta do it.
-I know. But it's just so hard.

23
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:15,510
You're sitting with her.
She has no idea what's happening.

24
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,221
You finally get up
the courage to do it.

25
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:21,767
There's that awkward moment
when you've handed her the note.

26
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,731
Why do you have to break up with her?

27
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,567
Be a man. Just stop calling.

28
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,113
If you want, I'll do it with you.

29
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:38,992
Thanks, but she'd feel like
we were ganging up on her.

30
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,870
I mean you break up with Janice.
I'll break up with Tony.

31
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,538
You're breaking up with Tony?

32
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:46,458
I know. He's sweet, but it's just
not fun anymore.

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:50,003
I don't know if it's me or
his hunger strike. I don't know.

34
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,882
Does anybody want anything else?

35
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:58,637
Yeah. Last week you had a wonderful nutty,
chocolate-y, kind of cake-y pie thing that-

36
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:01,807
Nothing. I'm fine.

37
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,395
What's the matter?
Why so scrunchie?

38
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,065
It's my father. He wants to give me
a Mercedes convertible.

39
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:14,194
That guy, he burns me up.

40
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,781
Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes
if I move back home.

41
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,951
It was horrible!
He called me "young lady."

42
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,578
Ooh, I hate when my father
calls me that.

43
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:27,958
Did he give you that whole
"You're not up to this" thing again?

44
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:31,169
Yeah, I got the extended disco
version with three choruses of:

45
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,255
"You'll never make it on your own."

46
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:34,798
<i>Uh-huh, uh-huh</i>

47
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,845
Hi, Joey.

48
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,264
Oh, my God. Angela.

49
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,684
Wow. Being dumped by you
obviously agrees with her.

50
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,811
-Are you gonna go over there?
-No.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:50,105
Yeah. No.

52
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:54,234
Okay, but not yet.
I don't wanna seem too eager.

53
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,865
One Mississippi, two Mississippi...

54
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:02,325
...three Mississippi.
That seems pretty cool.

55
00:04:06,705 --> 00:04:07,956
Hey, Angela.

56
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,249
Joey.

57
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,709
You look good.

58
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,254
Because I'm wearing a dress
that accents my boobs.

59
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:22,971
You don't say.

60
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:27,434
So, Rachel, what are you
doing tonight?

61
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:30,729
Big glamour night.
Me and Monica at Launderama.

62
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,063
Oh.

63
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:36,151
You wanna hear a freakish coincidence?

64
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,195
Guess who's doing laundry there too?

65
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,363
-Who?
-Me.

66
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,991
Was that not clear?

67
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:47,662
Hey, why don't-?

68
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,999
Why don't I just
join you both there?

69
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,668
Don't you have a laundry room
in your building?

70
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,379
Yes.

71
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,550
I do have a laundry room
in my building.

72
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:05,263
Urn- But there's a rat problem.

73
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,725
Apparently, they're attracted to
the dryer sheets.

74
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,811
They're going in fine,
but they're coming out all...

75
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:13,605
...fluffy.

76
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,692
Anyway, 7-ish?

77
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,069
Sure.

78
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:24,324
Forget it, Joey.
I'm with Bob now.

79
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,868
Bob? Who the hell's Bob?

80
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,495
Bob is great.

81
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,873
He's smart, he's sophisticated,
and he has a real job.

82
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:36,044
You go on three auditions a month
and you call yourself an actor. But Bob-

83
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:39,297
Come on. We were great together.

84
00:05:39,548 --> 00:05:43,927
And not just at the fun stuff,
but, like, talking too.

85
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,100
Sorry, Joey. You said,
"Let's just be friends."

86
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,810
So guess what?

87
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:54,145
-What?
-We're just friends.

88
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,064
Fine. Fine.

89
00:05:56,314 --> 00:06:00,068
So why don't the four of us go out and
have dinner tonight? You know, as friends.

90
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,653
What "four of us"?

91
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:05,365
You and Bob,
and me and my girlfriend, urn...

92
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,159
...Monica.

93
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,288
JOEY: Monica, I'm telling you, this guy
is perfect for you.

94
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:15,292
Forget it! Not after your cousin
who could belch the alphabet.

95
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,046
Come on, this guy's great.
His name's Bob. He's Angela's...

96
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:21,423
...ahem, brother.

97
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,675
He's smart, he's sophisticated...

98
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:25,677
...and he has a real job.

99
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:29,848
Me, I go on three auditions a month
and call myself an actor, but Bob is—

100
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,683
-Oh, God, help us.
-What?

101
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,269
Ugly Naked Guy is laying kitchen tile.

102
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,647
BOTH:
Ew!

103
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,650
Look, I'm asking a favor here.

104
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,361
I'm thinking if I do this
for her brother...

105
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,447
...maybe Angela will come back to me.

106
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,992
What's going on here?
You go out with tons of girls.

107
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,660
I know, but....

108
00:06:52,621 --> 00:06:57,125
Look, I made a huge mistake.
I never should've broke up with her.

109
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,669
Will you help me? Please?

110
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,928
Okay. Bye.

111
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:12,390
Monica's not coming.
It's just gonna be me and Rachel.

112
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:16,853
Hold on there, camper.
You sure you've thought this through?

113
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:20,273
It's laundry. The thinking
through is pretty minimal.

114
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:23,526
It's just you and Rachel?
Just the two of you?

115
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:26,029
This is a date.
You're going on a date.

116
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,990
Nuh-uh.

117
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:32,577
Yeah-huh.

118
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:34,871
What are you saying?

119
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:37,540
I should shave again?
Pick up some wine? What?

120
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,127
Well, you may wanna rethink
the dirty underwear.

121
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,549
It's the first time she'll see your
underwear. You want it to be dirty?

122
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,180
No.

123
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,809
And the fabric softener?

124
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,812
Okay, okay.
Now, what is wrong with my Snuggles?

125
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:04,067
What? It says I'm a sensitive,
warm kind of guy.

126
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,778
You know, like a little fuzzy bear.

127
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:11,366
I can pick something else
up on the way.

128
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,080
MONICA:
Thank you.

129
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,500
So what does this Bob guy
look like? Is he tall, short?

130
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,627
Yep.

131
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,462
Which?

132
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,172
Which what?

133
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,801
You've never met Bob, have you?

134
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,094
No, but-

135
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,722
For all we know,
he could be horribly-

136
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,102
Horribly attractive.
I'll be shutting up now.

137
00:08:44,149 --> 00:08:46,401
Where are they? Where are they?

138
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:49,946
This is nice. We never
do anything, just the two of us.

139
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:54,743
That's great. Maybe tomorrow we can
rent a car, run over some puppies.

140
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,494
Ew. I don't wanna do that.

141
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,000
-Here we go.
-Have a good breakup.

142
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:07,380
-Hey, Janice.
-My God, I am so glad you called me.

143
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:10,842
I had the most supremely awful day.

144
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:13,470
That's not good.

145
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,891
Can I get an espresso
and a latte over here, please?

146
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,061
We got the proofs from that
photo shoot with the vegetables.

147
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,353
They sucked.

148
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,565
I blew off the rest of the afternoon.
I went shopping.

149
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,735
And I got you....

150
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,946
JANICE:
I'm looking. I'm looking.

151
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,491
I'm looking.

152
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,493
-I got you-
-What?

153
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:40,413
-What?
-What did you get me there?

154
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,124
I got you...

155
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,001
...these.

156
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:47,754
Bullwinkle socks.

157
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,381
-That's so sweet.
-I knew you had the Rockys.

158
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,717
So you could wear
Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle...

159
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:56,054
...or wear Rocky and Rocky,
or you can mix and match.

160
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,139
Moose and squirrel.

161
00:09:58,348 --> 00:10:00,225
Whatever you want.

162
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,940
I'm gonna get another espresso.
More latte?

163
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,692
No.

164
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,154
No, I'm still working on mine.

165
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,827
That's it?

166
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,495
Yeah, it was really hard.

167
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,872
Yeah, the hug looked pretty brutal.

168
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,833
Okay, you weren't there.

169
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,056
WOMAN:
Coming through! Move! Move!

170
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,648
Excuse me! I was kind of
using that machine.

171
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:51,317
Yeah, well, now you're kind of not.

172
00:10:52,527 --> 00:10:55,405
But I saved it.
I put my basket on top.

173
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,116
-I'm sorry. Is that your basket?
-Yes.

174
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,369
It's really pretty.
Unfortunately, I don't see suds!

175
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:04,956
What?

176
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:09,294
No suds, no save, okay?

177
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,631
-What's going on?
-Hi.

178
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,594
Nothing. This horrible woman
just took my machine.

179
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,345
Was your basket on top?

180
00:11:19,596 --> 00:11:21,806
-Yeah, but there were no suds.
-So?

181
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,558
You know, no suds, no save.

182
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,768
No suds, no- Excuse me.

183
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,604
Hold on a second!

184
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:29,981
This is my friend's machine.

185
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,400
Hey, hey, hey!
Her stuff wasn't in it!

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:36,654
Hey, hey, hey! That's not
the rule, and you know it!

187
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:48,708
All right. Show's over.

188
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,880
Nothing to see here.

189
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:58,468
Okay. Let's do laundry.

190
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,472
That was amazing!
I can't even send back soup.

191
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:07,226
Well, that's because you're
such a sweet, gentle....

192
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,730
Do you, uh...?

193
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,441
Oh, hey. You must need detergent.

194
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:19,364
-What's that?
-Uberweiss.

195
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:23,451
It's new. It's German.
It's extra tough!

196
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:27,747
Rach, do you-?
Are you gonna separate those?

197
00:12:29,332 --> 00:12:31,334
Oh, God. Ugh.

198
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,962
Am I being like a total laundry spaz?

199
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:38,049
Am I supposed to use one machine
for shirts and another for pants?

200
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:44,681
Have you-?
Have you never done this before?

201
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:48,059
Well, not myself.
But I know other people that have.

202
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,897
Okay. You caught me.
I'm a laundry virgin.

203
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,610
Don't worry.
I'll use the gentle cycle.

204
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,989
Okay....

205
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,952
Basically, you wanna use
one machine for all your whites.

206
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,161
Whites. Okay.

207
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,664
-A whole other machine for your colors.
-Colors.

208
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,709
And then a third for your, uh...

209
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:17,338
...delicates.
And that would be your bras...

210
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:20,842
...and your underpanty things.

211
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:26,055
Okay, well,
these are white cotton panties.

212
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:28,766
Would they go with whites
or with delicates?

213
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:31,477
That would be a judgment call.

214
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,443
He's so cute!

215
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,071
So where did you guys grow up?

216
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,365
-Brooklyn Heights.
-Cleveland.

217
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,783
Ha. Heh, hen, heh.

218
00:13:46,034 --> 00:13:47,827
-How did that happen?
-Oh, my God!

219
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,620
What?

220
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:52,373
I suddenly had the feeling I was...

221
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,208
...falling.

222
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,586
But I'm not.

223
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:09,057
So you and Angela, huh?

224
00:14:09,307 --> 00:14:11,517
Yep. Pretty much.

225
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:13,394
-You're a lucky man.
-Yeah.

226
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,564
You know what I miss
the most about her?

227
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:20,068
That cute nibbley noise
she makes when she eats.

228
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,363
Like a happy little squirrel...

229
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,698
...or a weasel.

230
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,534
I never really noticed.

231
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:31,162
Oh, yeah, yeah. Listen for it.

232
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,040
Monica. Monica is great.

233
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,542
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

234
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:38,961
But it's not gonna last.

235
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,007
She's too much for me in bed.

236
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,259
Sexually.

237
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,808
I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific.

238
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:53,351
Yeah, isn't he?

239
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,479
It's so great to meet a guy
who's smart and funny...

240
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,065
...and has an emotional age beyond 8.

241
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:02,819
You know what else?
He's unbelievable in bed!

242
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,239
Wow!

243
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,034
My brother never even told me
when he lost his virginity.

244
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,495
Huh.

245
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:14,455
That's nice.

246
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,672
You can do this. It's like
pulling off a Band-Aid.

247
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,926
Just do it really fast,
and then the wound is exposed.

248
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,678
Go! Go!

249
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,771
Janice....

250
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,733
Hi, Janice.

251
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:47,822
Okay, here we go.
I don't think we should go out anymore.

252
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,868
Janice.

253
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:56,622
All right.

254
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,334
Well....

255
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,087
Well, there you go.

256
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,506
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

257
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,306
RACHEL: Okay, I know this is gonna sound
really stupid...

258
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,808
...but I feel that if I can do this...

259
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:18,936
...if I can actually do
my own laundry...

260
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,022
...there isn't anything I can't do.

261
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,358
That does not sound stupid to me.

262
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:28,654
No, it's like- The first time I had to make
dinner for myself after Carol left me....

263
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,950
I'm sorry, that's all the time
we have. Next on Ross....

264
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:35,536
Okay.

265
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:36,954
-Uh-oh.
-What, "uh-oh"?

266
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,331
Uh-oh....

267
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,459
Uh-oh, the laundry's done.

268
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,629
It's a song.

269
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,714
The laundry song that we sing.

270
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:51,093
<i>Uh-oh, the laundry's done</i>

271
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:52,970
What's the matter?

272
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,305
Nothing. Nothing.

273
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,890
<i>The laundry's done</i>

274
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,225
Come on, show me.

275
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,562
It's just that you left a red sock
in with your whites, and now...

276
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,401
-...everything's kind of pink.
-Oh.

277
00:17:07,944 --> 00:17:09,320
Everything's pink?

278
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,323
Except for the red sock,
which is still red.

279
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,284
Don't be upset.
It can happen to anyone.

280
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,411
But it didn't.
It happened to me.

281
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:21,249
God, I'm gonna look like
a big Marshmallow Peep!

282
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,292
What am I doing? What am I doing?

283
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,712
My father's right!
I can't live on my own.

284
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:29,423
I can't even do laundry!

285
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:42,812
Something went wrong
with Underdog...

286
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,273
...and they couldn't get
his head to inflate.

287
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,192
So anyway...

288
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,238
...his head is, like,
flopping down Broadway.

289
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:54,448
And I'm thinking...

290
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:58,411
...how inappropriate this is.

291
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,790
I've got something's in my eye.
Joey, could we check it in the light, please?

292
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:07,545
-Oh, my God!
-What?

293
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,506
Hello! Were we at
the same table? It's like...

294
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,009
...cocktails in Appalachia.

295
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:21,684
-Come on, they're close.
-Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.

296
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,480
Like you've never got a little
rambunctious with Ross.

297
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:31,402
Joey, this is sick.
It's disgusting. It's...

298
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,904
...not really true, is it?

299
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,823
Who's to say what's true?

300
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,158
What were you thinking?

301
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,952
Look, I'm not proud of this, okay?

302
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,620
Well, maybe I am a little.

303
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,497
-Oh.
-Ow!

304
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,583
-I'm out of here!
-Wait! Come on!

305
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,668
You like him. I want her.

306
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,337
He likes you.

307
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,006
-Really?
-Yeah.

308
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,968
I'm thinking, if we put our heads
together, between the two of us...

309
00:18:56,177 --> 00:18:58,262
...we can break them up.

310
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,517
MONICA: I'm so sorry.
I can't believe I did this.

311
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:07,229
I just couldn't stop laughing
at your Norman Mailer story.

312
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,822
Waiter? One more plate of
chicken wings over here.

313
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:25,498
Here's the thing.
It's like we're different.

314
00:19:25,748 --> 00:19:27,708
I'm the bing, you're the boom-

315
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:29,001
JANICE: Ow!
-Oh!

316
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:30,544
-Oh, my God!
-Ow!

317
00:19:30,753 --> 00:19:31,796
-I'm so sorry!
-Ow!

318
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,631
-Are you okay?
-Ow!

319
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,884
It's just my lens. It's my lens.

320
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,136
I'll be right back.

321
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,849
I hit her in the eye!
I hit her in the eye!

322
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:47,603
This is the worst breakup
in the history of the world!

323
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:49,605
Oh, my God.

324
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,192
How many of those have you had?

325
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:55,611
I don't know. A million!

326
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:59,740
Chandler, shh, shh. Easy, easy.
Go to your happy place.

327
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:02,159
<i>La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

328
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,663
-I'm fine, I'm fine.
-All right.

329
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,707
I'm not fine. Here she comes.

330
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,750
Wait here, okay? Breathe.

331
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,062
How do you do that?

332
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,356
It's like a gift.

333
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:37,361
We should always, always break up
together.

334
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,737
I'd like that.

335
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:43,993
ROSS: You got the clothes clean.
That's the important part.

336
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,580
I guess. Except everything
looks like jammies now.

337
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,670
Whoa, I'm sorry.

338
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,423
Excuse me. We had this cart.

339
00:20:58,132 --> 00:21:00,843
I had a 24-inch waist.
You lose things.

340
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:03,345
Now, come on.
Get out of my way.

341
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:07,224
I'm sorry. Maybe I wasn't
being clear. This was our cart.

342
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,477
Hey, hey, hey.
There aren't any clothes in it!

343
00:21:09,727 --> 00:21:12,313
Hey, hey, hey!
Quit making up rules!

344
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:15,941
Let go! Come on, this is my cart.
You know I saw it first.

345
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:18,402
Listen, Mitzi, if you
want this cart...

346
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,155
...you're gonna have to
take me with it!

347
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,331
Yes! Did you see that?

348
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:31,790
You were incredible.

349
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,502
A brand-new woman,
ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:37,087
I could not have
done this without you.

351
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,678
ROSS:
Okay, urn....

352
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:47,806
Uh- More clothes in the dryer?

353
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:52,186
-I'm fine. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

354
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,192
-Are you sure you're okay?
-Yeah.

355
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,486
-Does it still hurt?
-Yeah.

356
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:06,951
What a neat idea. All your
clothes match. I'm gonna do this.

357
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,745
MONICA:
Hi!

358
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:10,996
PHOEBE:
How'd it go?

359
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:12,248
Excellent!

360
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:16,752
We ripped that couple apart
and kept the pieces for ourselves.

361
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,338
What a beautiful story.

362
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:23,092
I'm fine, by the way.

363
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,677
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,097
-Where's Chandler?
-He needed some time to grieve.

365
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,599
CHANDLER:
I'm free! I'm free!

366
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,270
That ought to do it.
