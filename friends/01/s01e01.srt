1
00:00:50,037 --> 00:00:52,832
There's nothing to tell.
It's just some guy I work with.

2
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:55,209
Come on.
You're going out with a guy.

3
00:00:55,376 --> 00:00:57,920
There's gotta be something
wrong with him.

4
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:00,006
So does he have a hump
and a hair piece?

5
00:01:02,466 --> 00:01:03,843
Wait. Does he eat chalk?

6
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:08,305
I don't want her to go through
what I went through with Carl. Oh.

7
00:01:08,514 --> 00:01:11,308
Okay, everybody relax.
This is not even a date.

8
00:01:11,517 --> 00:01:14,478
It's just two people going out
to dinner and not having sex.

9
00:01:14,687 --> 00:01:16,230
Sounds like a date to me.

10
00:01:19,108 --> 00:01:21,944
I'm back in high school,
in the middle of the cafeteria...

11
00:01:22,153 --> 00:01:25,489
...and I realize I'm totally naked.

12
00:01:25,698 --> 00:01:27,241
-Oh, yeah.
-I've had that dream.

13
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:31,537
Then I look down and I realize
there is a phone...

14
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:34,081
...there.

15
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,917
-Instead of-
-That's right!

16
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:38,627
MONICA: That one, I've never had.
PHOEBE: No.

17
00:01:38,794 --> 00:01:42,923
All of a sudden,
the phone starts to ring.

18
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:44,884
And it turns out it's my mother.

19
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:50,931
Which is very, very weird
because she never calls me.

20
00:01:55,936 --> 00:01:57,855
Hi.

21
00:01:58,856 --> 00:02:02,026
This guy says "hello,"
I wanna kill myself.

22
00:02:02,318 --> 00:02:03,486
Are you okay, sweetie?

23
00:02:03,736 --> 00:02:08,407
I feel like someone grabbed my small
intestine, pulled it out of my mouth...

24
00:02:08,574 --> 00:02:11,452
-...and tied it around my neck.
-Cookie?

25
00:02:13,454 --> 00:02:14,955
Carol moved her stuff out today.

26
00:02:15,164 --> 00:02:16,207
PHOEBE & JOEY:
Oh.

27
00:02:16,373 --> 00:02:18,167
-Let me get you some coffee.
-Thanks.

28
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,880
Ew. Unh.

29
00:02:23,047 --> 00:02:27,009
No. No, don't!
Stop cleansing my aura.

30
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:29,845
Just leave my aura alone, okay?

31
00:02:31,847 --> 00:02:34,725
I'll be fine. All right? Really.
I hope she'll be very happy.

32
00:02:34,892 --> 00:02:36,227
-No, you don't.
-No, I don't.

33
00:02:36,393 --> 00:02:38,229
To hell with her. She left me!

34
00:02:39,271 --> 00:02:41,232
And you never knew she was a lesbian.

35
00:02:45,277 --> 00:02:47,446
No! Okay?

36
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:50,407
Why does everyone
keep fixating on that?

37
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:54,829
She didn't know. How should I know?

38
00:02:56,664 --> 00:02:59,333
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian.

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,962
Did I say that out loud?

40
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:08,968
All right, Ross. Look, you're feeling
a lot of pain right now.

41
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:11,554
You're angry. You're hurting.

42
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:14,014
Can I tell you what the answer is?

43
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:15,516
Strip joints!

44
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:20,020
Come on, you're single.
Have some hormones.

45
00:03:20,229 --> 00:03:22,523
See, but I don't want
to be single, okay?

46
00:03:22,731 --> 00:03:25,901
I just wanna be married again.

47
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,159
And I just want a million dollars!

48
00:03:34,285 --> 00:03:35,369
Rachel?

49
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:38,247
Oh, God, Monica! Hi! Thank God!

50
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:41,584
I went to your building and
this guy with a hammer said...

51
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,961
...that you might be here, and you are.

52
00:03:44,211 --> 00:03:47,715
-Can I get you some coffee?
-Decaf.

53
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:52,261
Okay, everybody, this is Rachel,
another Lincoln High survivor.

54
00:03:52,511 --> 00:03:54,972
This is everybody.
This is Chandler and Phoebe...

55
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:57,433
...and Joey. And remember
my brother, Ross?

56
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,726
-Sure!
-Hey.

57
00:03:58,893 --> 00:04:00,811
-Hi.
-Oh, God.

58
00:04:08,611 --> 00:04:12,198
So you wanna tell us now, or are we
waiting for four wet bridesmaids?

59
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:19,413
Oh, God! Well, it started about
a half-hour before the wedding.

60
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,999
I was in this room
with all the presents...

61
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,001
...and I was looking
at this gravy boat.

62
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:27,630
This really gorgeous
Limoges gravy boat.

63
00:04:27,796 --> 00:04:29,632
When all of a sudden-
Sweet 'N Low?

64
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,926
-I realized...

65
00:04:32,092 --> 00:04:36,013
...I was more turned on by
this gravy boat than by Barry.

66
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,225
Then I got really freaked out,
and that's when it hit me:

67
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,186
How much Barry looks
like Mr. Potato Head.

68
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:45,856
You know, I mean, I always knew
he looked familiar, but....

69
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:51,362
Anyway, I just had to get out of there,
and I started wondering:

70
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:55,199
"Why am I doing this?"
and "Who am I doing this for?"

71
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:59,745
Anyway, I just didn't know where to go,
and I know you and I have drifted apart...

72
00:04:59,954 --> 00:05:02,790
...but you're the only person
I know in the city.

73
00:05:02,998 --> 00:05:04,667
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.

74
00:05:05,042 --> 00:05:07,962
Oh, I was kind of hoping that
wouldn't be an issue.

75
00:05:22,142 --> 00:05:24,645
I'm guessing he bought her
the big pipe organ...

76
00:05:24,812 --> 00:05:27,273
...and she's really not
happy about it.

77
00:05:28,524 --> 00:05:31,568
Daddy, I just- I can't marry him.

78
00:05:31,735 --> 00:05:33,404
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:36,448
I just don't love him.

80
00:05:36,907 --> 00:05:39,576
Well, it matters to me.

81
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:44,456
CHANDLER:
She should not be wearing those pants.

82
00:05:45,666 --> 00:05:47,626
I say push her down the stairs.

83
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:51,046
ALL: Push her down the stairs!
Push her down the stairs!

84
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:57,303
Come on, Daddy, listen to me!

85
00:05:57,511 --> 00:06:02,057
It's like all of my life, everyone's
always told me, "You're a shoe!

86
00:06:02,224 --> 00:06:04,310
You're a shoe! You're a shoe!
You're a shoe!"

87
00:06:04,518 --> 00:06:07,688
Then today I stopped and said,
"What if I don't wanna be a shoe?

88
00:06:07,896 --> 00:06:11,066
What if I wanna be a purse?
You know?

89
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:13,027
Or a hat?"

90
00:06:13,944 --> 00:06:16,488
I don't want you to buy me a hat,
I am a hat.

91
00:06:16,655 --> 00:06:18,866
It's a metaphor, Daddy!

92
00:06:20,617 --> 00:06:22,453
You can see where he'd have trouble.

93
00:06:25,706 --> 00:06:27,583
Look, Daddy, it's my life.

94
00:06:28,917 --> 00:06:31,378
Well, maybe I'll just stay
here with Monica.

95
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,884
I guess we've established
she's staying with Monica.

96
00:06:38,969 --> 00:06:41,764
Well, maybe that's my decision.

97
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,600
Well, maybe I don't need your money.

98
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,019
Wait! Wait! I said maybe!

99
00:06:53,984 --> 00:06:56,195
Okay. Just breathe, that's it.

100
00:06:56,403 --> 00:06:58,864
Just try to think of nice, calm things.

101
00:06:59,073 --> 00:07:02,951
<i>Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens</i>

102
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:07,289
<i>Doorbells and sleigh bells
And something with mittens</i>

103
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,418
<i>La la la something
With string</i>

104
00:07:11,585 --> 00:07:13,462
I'm all better now.

105
00:07:15,255 --> 00:07:17,257
I helped.

106
00:07:18,926 --> 00:07:21,261
MONICA: Look, this is probably
for the best, you know?

107
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:24,139
Independence. Taking control of your life.

108
00:07:24,348 --> 00:07:28,685
And, hey, if you need anything,
you can always come to Joey.

109
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:32,272
Me and Chandler live right
across the hall. And he's away a lot.

110
00:07:34,149 --> 00:07:36,693
Joey, stop hitting on her.
It's her wedding day.

111
00:07:36,902 --> 00:07:38,862
What? Like there's a rule or something?

112
00:07:41,407 --> 00:07:44,952
Please don't do that again.
It's a horrible sound.

113
00:07:45,119 --> 00:07:47,538
PAUL: <i>Uh, it's Paul.
</i>-Buzz him in.

114
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,124
-Who's Paul?
-Paul, the wine guy, Paul?

115
00:07:50,332 --> 00:07:51,375
Maybe.

116
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:54,878
Wait a minute. Your "not a real date"
is with Paul, the wine guy?

117
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:56,880
-He finally asked you out?
-Yes.

118
00:07:57,047 --> 00:07:58,841
Ooh. This is a "Dear Diary" moment.

119
00:08:00,384 --> 00:08:01,885
Rach, wait, I can cancel.

120
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:03,929
Please, no. Go, I'll be fine.

121
00:08:04,096 --> 00:08:07,808
Ross, are you okay?
I mean, do you want me to stay?

122
00:08:08,684 --> 00:08:10,811
That'd be good.

123
00:08:11,186 --> 00:08:14,940
-Really?
-No, go on! It's Paul, the wine guy.

124
00:08:18,777 --> 00:08:21,196
MONICA:
Hi, come in. Paul, this is...

125
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:24,616
...everybody. Everybody, this is Paul.

126
00:08:25,075 --> 00:08:26,118
JOEY:
Paul, the wine guy.

127
00:08:26,326 --> 00:08:30,164
-Wine guy.
-I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?

128
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:33,125
-Okay. Sit down. Two seconds.
-Okay.

129
00:08:37,296 --> 00:08:40,382
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes.
That can't be good.

130
00:08:42,926 --> 00:08:44,803
So, Rachel,
what are you up to tonight?

131
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:49,183
Well, I was supposed to be headed
for Aruba on my honeymoon...

132
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,392
...so, nothing.

133
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:55,022
Right. You're not even
getting your honeymoon.

134
00:08:55,314 --> 00:08:59,276
God. No, no. Although, Aruba. Heh.
This time of year? Eh.

135
00:08:59,443 --> 00:09:02,029
Talk about your...

136
00:09:02,196 --> 00:09:03,238
...big lizards.

137
00:09:08,035 --> 00:09:10,746
Anyway, if you don't feel
like being alone tonight...

138
00:09:10,954 --> 00:09:13,790
...Joey and Chandler are
helping me with my furniture.

139
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:17,127
Yes, and we're very excited about it.

140
00:09:17,294 --> 00:09:20,631
Actually, thanks, but I'm just gonna
hang out here tonight.

141
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,841
-It's been a long day.
-Oh, sure. Okay. Sure.

142
00:09:23,008 --> 00:09:24,343
Hey, Pheebs, you wanna help?

143
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,720
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.

144
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:39,358
I'm supposed to attach a bracket-y
thing to the side things...

145
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,319
...using a bunch of these
little worm guys.

146
00:09:43,487 --> 00:09:48,242
I have no bracket-y thing,
I see no worm guys whatsoever...

147
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:51,495
...and I cannot feel my legs.

148
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,122
What's this?

149
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:57,334
I have no idea.

150
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,630
-Done with the bookcase.
-All finished.

151
00:10:05,217 --> 00:10:07,010
This was Carol's favorite beer.

152
00:10:09,096 --> 00:10:11,765
She always drank it out of the can.
I should have known.

153
00:10:11,932 --> 00:10:15,143
Hey. Ross, let me ask you a question.

154
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:19,523
She got the furniture,
the stereo, the good TV.

155
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,732
What did you get?

156
00:10:21,066 --> 00:10:22,109
You guys.

157
00:10:22,276 --> 00:10:24,361
-Oh, God. Oh, my God.
-You got screwed.

158
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:28,865
-Oh, my God.
-I know, I know. I'm such an idiot.

159
00:10:29,408 --> 00:10:33,954
I should've caught on when she went to
the dentist four and five times a week.

160
00:10:34,121 --> 00:10:36,331
I mean, how clean can teeth get?

161
00:10:36,498 --> 00:10:38,917
My brother's going through that.
He's such a mess.

162
00:10:39,084 --> 00:10:40,752
How did you get through it?

163
00:10:40,961 --> 00:10:44,464
He might try accidentally breaking
something valuable of hers.

164
00:10:44,631 --> 00:10:46,216
-Say her-
-Leg?

165
00:10:46,383 --> 00:10:48,302
Heh. That's one way of going through it,
yeah.

166
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:50,387
Me, I went for the watch.

167
00:10:50,846 --> 00:10:52,723
-You actually broke her watch?
-Mm.

168
00:10:53,348 --> 00:10:56,435
Barry, I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

169
00:10:56,685 --> 00:11:01,607
You probably think it's about making
love with your socks on, but it isn't.

170
00:11:01,773 --> 00:11:04,610
It isn't, it's about me. And I-

171
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:14,703
Hi. Machine cut me off again.
Anyway....

172
00:11:16,496 --> 00:11:20,584
You know what's scary? What if
there's only one woman for everybody?

173
00:11:20,792 --> 00:11:24,129
I mean, what if you get one
woman, and that's it?

174
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:29,176
Unfortunately, in my case,
there was only one woman for her.

175
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:32,888
What are you talking about?
One woman.

176
00:11:33,472 --> 00:11:37,100
That's like saying there's only
one flavor of ice cream for you.

177
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:41,021
Let me tell you something, Ross.
There's lots of flavors out there.

178
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:45,651
There's rocky road and cookie dough
and bing cherry vanilla.

179
00:11:46,276 --> 00:11:50,781
You can get them with jimmies
or nuts or whipped cream.

180
00:11:51,031 --> 00:11:53,700
This is the best thing that
ever happened to you.

181
00:11:53,867 --> 00:11:56,745
You got married. You were like, what, 8?

182
00:11:58,705 --> 00:12:02,709
Welcome back to the world. Grab a spoon.

183
00:12:02,876 --> 00:12:05,420
I honestly don't know
if I'm hungry or horny.

184
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:07,255
Then stay out of my freezer.

185
00:12:11,009 --> 00:12:14,429
Ever since she walked out on me, I....

186
00:12:14,763 --> 00:12:16,723
What? What?

187
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,725
You wanna spell it out with noodles?

188
00:12:18,934 --> 00:12:22,521
No, it's more of a fifth date
kind of revelation.

189
00:12:23,313 --> 00:12:26,358
Oh, so there's gonna be a fifth date?

190
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:29,569
Isn't there?

191
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,947
Yeah, yeah. I think there is.

192
00:12:33,782 --> 00:12:35,492
What were you gonna say?

193
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,246
Well.... Er, uh-

194
00:12:40,414 --> 00:12:42,624
Ever since she left me, urn...

195
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,045
...I haven't been able to perform...

196
00:12:47,295 --> 00:12:48,505
...sexually.

197
00:12:51,383 --> 00:12:52,884
Oh, God! Oh, God! I am so-

198
00:12:53,093 --> 00:12:54,302
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

199
00:12:54,511 --> 00:12:57,931
Being spit on is probably
not what you need right now.

200
00:12:58,098 --> 00:12:59,808
Urn....

201
00:13:00,183 --> 00:13:01,268
How long?

202
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:02,894
Two years.

203
00:13:03,645 --> 00:13:05,355
Wow!

204
00:13:05,522 --> 00:13:08,483
I'm glad you smashed her watch.

205
00:13:10,444 --> 00:13:13,864
So you still think you might
want that fifth date?

206
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,410
Yeah.

207
00:13:18,577 --> 00:13:20,412
Yeah, I do.

208
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:24,958
<i>/, Joanie, take you, Charles,
as my lawful husband.</i>

209
00:13:25,292 --> 00:13:28,545
MINISTER: <i>Do you take Joanie-?
</i>-Oh! See.

210
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:33,925
But Joanie loved Chachi.
That's the difference.

211
00:13:35,469 --> 00:13:36,845
"Grab a spoon."

212
00:13:37,179 --> 00:13:39,681
Do you know long it's been
since I grabbed a spoon?

213
00:13:40,182 --> 00:13:43,018
Do the words, "Billy, don't be
a hero," mean anything to you?

214
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:49,775
You know, here's the thing.
Even if I could get it together enough...

215
00:13:49,941 --> 00:13:52,486
...to ask a woman out...

216
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:55,363
...who am I gonna ask?

217
00:14:16,676 --> 00:14:18,053
Isn't this amazing?

218
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,555
I mean, I have never made coffee
before in my life.

219
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:23,225
-That is amazing.
-Congratulations.

220
00:14:23,433 --> 00:14:28,146
While you're on a roll, if you feel like you
gotta make a Western omelet or something....

221
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:34,528
Although, actually I'm really
not that hungry this morning.

222
00:14:35,445 --> 00:14:36,780
-Good morning.
MONICA: Good morning.

223
00:14:36,947 --> 00:14:38,573
-Morning.
JOEY: Morning.

224
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,660
-Morning.
JOEY: Morning, Paul.

225
00:14:41,827 --> 00:14:45,038
-Hello, Paul.
-Hi. Paul, is it?

226
00:14:49,167 --> 00:14:51,920
MONICA:
I had a really great time last night.

227
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,964
PAUL:
Thank you. Thank you so much.

228
00:14:54,673 --> 00:14:57,551
-We'll talk later, okay?
-Yeah.

229
00:15:02,222 --> 00:15:04,057
Thank you.

230
00:15:09,896 --> 00:15:12,691
That wasn't a real date.

231
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,236
What the hell do you do
on a real date?

232
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:20,574
-Shut up and put my table back.
JOEY: Okay.

233
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,617
All right, kids, I gotta get to work.

234
00:15:22,826 --> 00:15:28,331
If I don't input those numbers,
it doesn't make much of a difference.

235
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:33,503
So, like, you guys all have jobs?

236
00:15:34,296 --> 00:15:35,964
Yeah, we all have jobs.

237
00:15:36,172 --> 00:15:38,800
See, that's how we buy stuff.

238
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:41,720
Yeah, I'm an actor.

239
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,139
Wow. Would I have seen you in anything?

240
00:15:44,347 --> 00:15:46,683
Oh, I doubt it. Mostly regional work.

241
00:15:46,892 --> 00:15:50,478
Unless you happened to catch the
Wee One's production of <i>Pinocchio.</i>

242
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:53,273
"Look, Geppeto. I'm a real live boy."

243
00:15:56,109 --> 00:15:57,819
I will not take this abuse.

244
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,988
You're right. I'm sorry.

245
00:16:00,405 --> 00:16:03,116
<i>Once I was a wooden boy
A little wooden boy</i>

246
00:16:07,203 --> 00:16:09,539
MONICA: So how are you doing today?
Did you sleep okay?

247
00:16:09,748 --> 00:16:13,084
Did you talk to Barry?
I can't stop smiling.

248
00:16:13,877 --> 00:16:17,756
I can see that. You look like you
slept with a hanger in your mouth.

249
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:26,473
I know. He's just so-

250
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,183
Remember you and Tony De Marco?

251
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:32,395
-Oh, yeah.
-Well, it's like that. With feelings.

252
00:16:33,271 --> 00:16:34,940
Oh, wow, are you in trouble!

253
00:16:35,607 --> 00:16:39,402
Okay, okay. I am just going to get up,
go to work...

254
00:16:39,569 --> 00:16:42,280
...and not think about him all day.

255
00:16:42,447 --> 00:16:45,408
Or else I'm just gonna
get up and go to work.

256
00:16:45,575 --> 00:16:47,202
-Oh, wish me luck!
-What for?

257
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,705
I'm gonna go get one
of those job things.

258
00:16:58,672 --> 00:17:01,299
-Hey, Monica.
-Hey, Franny. Welcome back.

259
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:02,968
How was Florida?

260
00:17:03,134 --> 00:17:04,469
You had sex, didn't you?

261
00:17:06,346 --> 00:17:07,389
How do you do that?

262
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:12,310
-So, who?
-You know Paul?

263
00:17:12,852 --> 00:17:14,437
Paul, the wine guy?

264
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:16,189
Oh, yeah, I know Paul.

265
00:17:18,733 --> 00:17:21,236
You mean, you know Paul
like I know Paul?

266
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:23,738
Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul.

267
00:17:23,905 --> 00:17:28,034
Before me, there was no snap
in his turtle for two years.

268
00:17:31,287 --> 00:17:33,832
Of course it was a line.

269
00:17:34,249 --> 00:17:36,918
Why? Why would anybody
do something like that?

270
00:17:37,127 --> 00:17:40,380
We're looking for an answer
more sophisticated than:

271
00:17:40,547 --> 00:17:42,465
"To get you into bed."

272
00:17:43,425 --> 00:17:45,093
Is it me?

273
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,805
Is it like I have some sort of
beacon that only dogs...

274
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:51,599
...and men with severe emotional
problems can hear?

275
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:53,727
All right, come here. Give me your feet.

276
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,069
I just thought he was nice, you know?

277
00:18:05,947 --> 00:18:08,408
I can't believe you
didn't know it was a line.

278
00:18:13,288 --> 00:18:14,330
Guess what.

279
00:18:14,497 --> 00:18:16,291
-You got a job?
-Are you kidding?

280
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,126
I'm trained for nothing.

281
00:18:19,961 --> 00:18:22,005
I was laughed out of 12 interviews today.

282
00:18:22,172 --> 00:18:23,715
Yet you're surprisingly upbeat.

283
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:27,427
Well, you would be too if you found
Joan and David boots on sale...

284
00:18:27,594 --> 00:18:29,345
...50 percent off.

285
00:18:29,554 --> 00:18:31,347
Oh, how well you know me.

286
00:18:33,016 --> 00:18:35,435
They're my new "I don't need
a job or my parents.

287
00:18:35,685 --> 00:18:37,854
I've got great boots" boots.

288
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,441
-How'd you pay for them?
-Uh, credit card.

289
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,651
And who pays for that?

290
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:46,404
Um, my father.

291
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,159
You can't live off your parents
your whole life.

292
00:18:51,367 --> 00:18:55,038
I know that. That's why
I was getting married.

293
00:18:55,413 --> 00:18:58,416
Give her a break. It's hard being
on your own for the first time.

294
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:00,085
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

295
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:02,962
I remember when I first came
to this city, I was 14.

296
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:06,007
My mom had killed herself
and my stepdad was back in prison.

297
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:08,218
And I got here,
and I didn't know anybody.

298
00:19:08,384 --> 00:19:11,763
I ended up living with this albino
guy who was cleaning windshields...

299
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:15,725
...outside Port Authority.
And then he killed himself.

300
00:19:16,476 --> 00:19:20,313
And then I found aromatherapy.
So believe me, I know exactly how you feel.

301
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:27,195
The word you're looking for is:

302
00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:29,030
"Anyway...."

303
00:19:33,201 --> 00:19:34,327
All right. You ready?

304
00:19:34,494 --> 00:19:36,204
-I don't think so.
ROSS: Oh, come on.

305
00:19:36,538 --> 00:19:37,956
Cut. Cut.

306
00:19:38,164 --> 00:19:41,126
ALL:
Cut, cut, cut.

307
00:19:42,752 --> 00:19:45,672
ROSS: Hey.
MONICA: All right.

308
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:47,632
Welcome to the real world.

309
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:50,593
It sucks. You're gonna love it.

310
00:19:57,517 --> 00:20:00,854
Well, that's it.
You gonna crash on the couch?

311
00:20:01,062 --> 00:20:04,399
-No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
-Are you gonna be okay?

312
00:20:04,566 --> 00:20:06,067
Yeah.

313
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:08,987
Look what I just found on the floor.

314
00:20:11,281 --> 00:20:12,532
What?

315
00:20:12,991 --> 00:20:14,492
That's Paul's watch.

316
00:20:14,659 --> 00:20:16,744
You can just put it back
where you found it.

317
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:21,833
Oh, boy. All right.
Good night, everybody.

318
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,042
ROSS & RACHEL:
Good night.

319
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:33,219
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

320
00:20:34,345 --> 00:20:35,597
-Oh, sorry.
-No. Oh, no. Go.

321
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,724
-No, have it, really.
-Split it?

322
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,893
-Okay.
-Okay.

323
00:20:41,811 --> 00:20:42,854
Thanks.

324
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:47,150
You probably didn't know this,
but back in high school I had...

325
00:20:47,317 --> 00:20:49,152
...a major crush on you.

326
00:20:50,612 --> 00:20:51,779
I knew.

327
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,407
You did? Oh.

328
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,203
I figured you thought I was
Monica's geeky older brother.

329
00:20:58,953 --> 00:21:00,955
-I did.
-Oh.

330
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:07,420
Listen, do you think-

331
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:11,090
And try not to let my vulnerability
become any kind of a factor here.

332
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:17,055
Do you think it would be okay if
I ask you out sometime, maybe?

333
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:20,141
Yeah.

334
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,893
Maybe.

335
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:24,729
Okay.

336
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,945
Okay, maybe I will.

337
00:21:35,907 --> 00:21:38,034
-Good night.
-Good night.

338
00:21:51,589 --> 00:21:53,299
See you.

339
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,842
ROSS:
Mm-hm.

340
00:21:55,009 --> 00:21:57,428
Wait, wait. Hey, what's with you?

341
00:21:59,722 --> 00:22:02,392
I just grabbed a spoon.

342
00:22:10,566 --> 00:22:12,026
Can't believe what I'm hearing.

343
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:13,945
<i>can't believe
What I'm hearing here</i>

344
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:16,322
-What? I said you had-
<i>-What? I said you had-</i>

345
00:22:17,365 --> 00:22:19,826
-Would you stop?
-Oh, was I doing it again?

346
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,869
ALL:
Yes.

347
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:24,914
WOMAN:
Would anybody like more coffee?

348
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:29,252
Did you make it or are you just serving it?

349
00:22:29,419 --> 00:22:32,714
-I'm just serving it.
CHANDLER: I'll have a cup of coffee.

350
00:22:33,172 --> 00:22:34,424
Kids, new dream.

351
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:38,511
I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minnelli.
