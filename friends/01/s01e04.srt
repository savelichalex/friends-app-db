1
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,253
PHOEBE:
Oh, that's good.

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,255
-Okay. All right, Phoebe?
-Okay, okay.

3
00:00:05,422 --> 00:00:09,885
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I would want, um, world peace...

4
00:00:10,093 --> 00:00:13,180
...no more hunger,
good things for the rain forest.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,557
And bigger boobs.

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,853
Well, see, you took mine, so....

7
00:00:21,063 --> 00:00:22,439
Chandler, what about you?

8
00:00:22,606 --> 00:00:26,026
If I were omnipotent for a day,
I'd make myself omnipotent forever.

9
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:28,529
Heh. See, there's always one guy.

10
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,406
"If I had a wish,
I'd wish for three more wishes."

11
00:00:34,076 --> 00:00:35,535
ROSS & MONICA: Hey, Joey.
-Hey, buddy.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,829
What would you do
if you were omnipotent?

13
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,832
Probably kill myself.

14
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,252
Excuse me?

15
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,089
Hey, if Little Joey's dead,
then I got no reason to live, you know?

16
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:51,385
Joey, uh, omnipotent.

17
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,055
You are?

18
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:56,932
Ross, I'm-

19
00:01:49,276 --> 00:01:51,486
How does she do that?

20
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,823
I cannot sleep in a public place.

21
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,325
Would you look at her?

22
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,661
-She's so peaceful.
-Yeah.

23
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,624
What? What? Hi.

24
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,959
It's okay, you know.
You just nodded off again.

25
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,128
-Oh.
-What's going on with you?

26
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,921
-I got no sleep last night.
ROSS: Why?

27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,091
My grandmother
has this new boyfriend...

28
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:17,179
...and they're both kind of insecure
in bed, so-

29
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:18,889
And deaf.

30
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,728
So they're constantly having to reassure
each other that they're having a good time.

31
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,938
You have no idea how loud they are.

32
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:32,110
-You can stay with Rachel and me tonight.
-Thanks.

33
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,279
Ninety-five, 96, 97.

34
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,659
See, I told you.
Less than 100 steps from our place to here.

35
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,662
You got way too much free time, man.

36
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:44,915
Hey, there's the birthday boy.

37
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,917
Ross, check it out. Hockey tickets.

38
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,711
Rangers-Penguins tonight at the Garden.
We're taking you.

39
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,880
-Happy birthday, pal.
-We love you, man.

40
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,219
It's funny,
my birthday was seven months ago.

41
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:00,097
-So?
-So I'm guessing you had an extra ticket...

42
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:03,558
...and couldn't decide
which one of you got to bring a date? Huh?

43
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,978
Well, aren't we
Mr. The-Glass-ls-Half-Empty?

44
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,690
Oh, my God. Oh.

45
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,858
Is today the 20th? October 20th?

46
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,569
-I was hoping you wouldn't remember.
-Oh.

47
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,154
What's wrong with the 20th?

48
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:19,700
Eleven days before Halloween?
All the good costumes are gone?

49
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:23,120
Today's the day Carol and I...

50
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,832
...first consummated...

51
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:29,793
...our physical relationship.

52
00:03:30,669 --> 00:03:32,462
We had sex.

53
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,717
You know what?
I better pass on the game.

54
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,972
I think I'm just gonna go home and think
about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover.

55
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,809
The hell with hockey. Let's all do that.

56
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,980
Come on, Ross. You, me, Joey, ice?

57
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:52,399
Guys' night out?
Come on, what do you say, big guy?

58
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:54,192
Huh? Huh? Huh?

59
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,778
-What are you doing?
-I have no idea.

60
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:58,196
Come on, Ross.

61
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,158
All right, all right.
Maybe it will take my mind off it.

62
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,827
-You promise to buy me a big foam finger?
JOEY: You got it.

63
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:06,913
-All right.
-Look, look, look. My first paycheck.

64
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,627
Look at the window.
There's my name. Hi, me.

65
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,839
I remember the day
I got my first paycheck.

66
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:19,426
There was a cave-in in one of the mines,
and eight people were killed.

67
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:22,971
Wow, you worked in a mine?

68
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,807
No, I worked at a Dairy Queen. Why?

69
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,897
God, isn't this exciting? I earned this.

70
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:34,524
I wiped tables for it. I steamed milk for it.

71
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,027
And it was totally...

72
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,488
...not worth it.

73
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,365
Who's FICA?
Why's he getting all my money?

74
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,661
I mean, what-? Chandler, look at that.

75
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,373
Oh, this is not that bad.

76
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,626
Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job.

77
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:58,924
-You can totally, totally live on this.
MONICA: Oh, yeah, yeah.

78
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,383
By the way, great service today.

79
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,676
-Ooh.
-Oh, yeah.

80
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,303
MONICA: Terrific.
-It was excellent.

81
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:06,473
CHANDLER: Unbelievable.
And all that milk and stuff? Great.

82
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,226
CHANDLER & JOEY: Hockey.
-Hockey. Hockey.

83
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,531
CHANDLER & JOEY: Hockey.
-Hockey. Hockey. Hockey.

84
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:25,617
Rachel?

85
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,036
Oh, my God!

86
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:37,087
I swear I've seen birds do this
on <i>Wild Kingdom.</i>

87
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:40,257
What are you guys doing here?

88
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,635
Well, we were in the city shopping,
and your mom said you work here...

89
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:46,137
...and it's true.

90
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:48,014
Yeah.

91
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:51,476
Look at you in the apron.
You look like you're in a play.

92
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,024
God, look at you. You are so big.
I can't believe it.

93
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,735
I know, I know. I'm a duplex.

94
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,697
RACHEL:
So, what's going on with you?

95
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:07,492
Well, guess who my dad's making partner
in his firm.

96
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:13,456
And while we're on the subject
of news....

97
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,961
Look, look. I have elbows.

98
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,720
Passes it up to Leetch.

99
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:28,889
Leetch spots Messier in the crease.
Here's the pass.

100
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,891
Oh. Oh.

101
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,270
We'll take a time-out while Messier stops
to look at some women's shoes.

102
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:41,026
Carol was wearing boots just like those
the night that we first...

103
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:42,652
...you know.

104
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,404
In fact, she, uh....

105
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:46,698
She never took them off. Ha, ha.

106
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:49,367
It's because we- Sorry. Sorry.

107
00:06:50,744 --> 00:06:51,828
I can't believe....

108
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,083
-What?
-Peach pit.

109
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,585
Yes, bunny?

110
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,338
Peach pit.

111
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,341
-That night, we, uh, had-
-Peaches?

112
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,968
Actually, nectarines, but basically.

113
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,139
-Could've been a peach.
-Then we, uh....

114
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:15,477
Then we got dressed
and I walked her to...

115
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:17,812
...the bus stop.

116
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,315
I'm fine.

117
00:07:20,482 --> 00:07:22,609
Hey, that woman's got an ass
like Carol's.

118
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,283
What?
I thought we were trying to find stuff.

119
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,120
Oh, come on, you guys.
Tell me all the dirt.

120
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:38,124
Well, the biggest news
is still you dumping Barry at the altar.

121
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:44,005
-All right, let's talk reality for a second.
-Okay.

122
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,508
-When are you coming home?
-What?

123
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,801
Guys, I'm not.

124
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:52,639
-Heh. Come on. This is us.
-I'm not.

125
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,309
This is what I'm doing now.
I've got this job.

126
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,144
Waitressing?

127
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:01,064
Heh. I'm not just waitressing.

128
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,692
I mean, I'm....

129
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,527
I, urn....

130
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:09,656
I write the specials
on the specials board.

131
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:13,993
And I take the dead flowers
out of the vase.

132
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:19,082
Um, oh, and sometimes Arturo lets me put
the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies.

133
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,085
Well, your mom didn't tell us
about the blobbies.

134
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,348
MONICA:
Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?

135
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,023
Okay, how would you like
some Tiki Death Punch?

136
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,232
What's that?

137
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
-Well, it's rum and-
-Okay.

138
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,199
We thought since Phoebe's staying over
we'd have a slumber party.

139
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,952
We got some trashy magazines,
we got cookie dough, we got Twister.

140
00:08:57,454 --> 00:08:59,873
Ooh, ooh. And I brought Operation.

141
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,002
But I lost the tweezers,
so we can't operate.

142
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:07,005
But we can prep the guy.

143
00:09:09,049 --> 00:09:11,259
Rach, it's the Visa-card people.

144
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,720
Oh, God. Ask them what they want.

145
00:09:13,887 --> 00:09:17,223
Could you please tell me
what this is in reference to?

146
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,142
Yes, hold on.

147
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:21,895
Um, they say there's been unusual activity
on your account.

148
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:26,316
-But I haven't used my card in weeks.
-That is the unusual activity.

149
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,653
They just wanna see if you're okay.

150
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,781
They wanna know if I'm okay?

151
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,283
Okay, they wanna know if I'm okay.
Okay, let's see.

152
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,870
Well, let's see.
The FICA guys took all my money.

153
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,916
Everyone I know is either getting married
or getting pregnant or getting promoted...

154
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,584
...and I'm getting coffee.

155
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,878
And it's not even for me.

156
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,632
So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay,
then you can tell them I'm okay. Okay?

157
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:56,846
Uh, Rachel has left the building.

158
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:01,518
-Can you call back?
-All right. Come on.

159
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,604
Let's play Twister.

160
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:16,116
-Sorry.
-Sorry, sorry, sorry.

161
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,659
Uh-oh.

162
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:20,578
What? There was ice there
that night with Carol?

163
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:24,833
Plastic seats?
Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?

164
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:29,212
No, actually, I was just saying
it looks like we're not sitting together.

165
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:33,132
But now that you mention it,
there was ice there that night.

166
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,261
It was the first frost.

167
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,347
-We were-
-Sit. Just sit down. Sit.

168
00:10:39,514 --> 00:10:40,807
You should feel great.

169
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,143
You're doing this amazing
independent thing.

170
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,436
Monica, what is so amazing?

171
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:50,066
I gave up like everything. And for what?

172
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:51,776
You are just like Jack.

173
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,736
Jack from downstairs?

174
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,407
No, <i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

175
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,368
-Ah, the other Jack.
-Yeah, right.

176
00:11:00,535 --> 00:11:04,163
See, he gave up something,
but then he got those magic beans.

177
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:08,543
And then he woke up
and there was this big plant...

178
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,171
...outside of his window,
full of possibilities and stuff.

179
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:16,009
And he lived in a village,
and you live in the Village.

180
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:20,013
Okay, but, Pheebs, Pheebs,
Jack gave up a cow.

181
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,473
I gave up an orthodontist.

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,018
Okay, I know I didn't love him, but-

183
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,937
Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.

184
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:31,316
But, see, it was a plan, you know?
It was clear.

185
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,694
Everything was figured out,
and now everything's just kind of like....

186
00:11:34,861 --> 00:11:36,905
-Flupie?
-Yeah.

187
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,159
You're not the only one.
We don't know where we're going.

188
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:44,078
You gotta figure, at some point,
it's gonna come together...

189
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:47,081
...and it's just gonna be "unflupie."

190
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,833
Yeah, like that's a word.

191
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:55,506
Okay, but, Monica,
what if it doesn't come together?

192
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,302
Pheebs?

193
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,681
Well, because you just-
I don't like this question.

194
00:12:04,891 --> 00:12:08,436
Okay, see? See, you guys?
What if we don't get magic beans?

195
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,272
I mean, what if all we've got are...

196
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,358
...beans?

197
00:12:16,945 --> 00:12:20,198
Get him! Get him! Get him!

198
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:23,576
Get- Yes!
You're not laughing now, are you, pal?

199
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,372
That's all you need, a bunch of toothless
guys hitting each other with sticks.

200
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,832
Pass it. Pass it.

201
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,878
CHANDLER: He's open, he's open.
Shoot it, shoot it, shoot it!

202
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,549
-Whoa. Oh.
-Whoa.

203
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,179
-Hey, look, we're on that TV thing.
-Ooh, ooh, ooh.

204
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,015
-I got it!
-Hey, hey, we got it! Hey!

205
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,778
Excuse me.

206
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:03,282
It says to call this number if you're not
completely satisfied with this candy bar.

207
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:10,415
Well, I'm not completely satisfied.

208
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,667
Listen, it's kind of an emergency.

209
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,295
I guess you'd know that,
or we'd be in the predicament room.

210
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,634
Hold on. Fill these out. Sit over there.

211
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,012
ROSS: Look, I don't wanna
make any trouble, okay?

212
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:28,474
But I'm in a lot of pain here, all right?
My face is dented.

213
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:32,895
-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
-Well, how long do you think it'll be?

214
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,897
Any minute now.

215
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:40,153
ROSS:
Hey, listen- Ooh.

216
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,828
<i>/ wake up and I start to cry</i>

217
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,955
<i>Ain't no hope in....</i>

218
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:56,210
Oh. I'm so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.

219
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,755
No, you were right.

220
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,716
I don't have a plan.

221
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:04,927
MAN:
Pizza guy.

222
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,013
-Thank God.
-Food.

223
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,390
-Phoebe?
PHOEBE: What?

224
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,811
-Do you have a plan?
-I don't even have a "pla."

225
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,608
Hi. One mushroom,
green pepper and onion?

226
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,820
No, no, no. That's not what we ordered.

227
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,116
We ordered a fat-free crust
with extra cheese.

228
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,330
-Wait, you're not G. Stephanopoulos?
-No.

229
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:35,625
-Oh, man. My dad's gonna kill me.
-Wait.

230
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:39,128
Did you say G. Stephanopoulos?

231
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,923
Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I must have given him yours.

232
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,384
Oh,bonehead. Bonehead.

233
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:49,889
Wait, was this a small Mediterranean guy
with curiously intelligent good looks?

234
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,266
Yeah, that sounds about right.

235
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:56,479
-Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
-And a power tie?

236
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,107
No, pretty much just a towel.

237
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,150
-Oh, God.
-Oh. Oh.

238
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,444
-Oh, my God.
-You want me to take this back?

239
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:07,448
What? Are you nuts?
We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza.

240
00:15:09,075 --> 00:15:10,535
Here.

241
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:13,704
-Uh, Pheebs?
-Yeah?

242
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,331
Who's George Snuffleupagus?

243
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,419
That's Big Bird's friend.

244
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,756
I see pizza.

245
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,050
PHOEBE:
Oh, I wanna see. Let me see. Let me see.

246
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,261
Hello? Who are we spying on?

247
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,639
You know the White House adviser?
Clinton's campaign guy?

248
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:35,226
The one with the great hair,
sexy smile, really cute butt?

249
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:39,397
Oh, him. The little guy. Oh, I love him.

250
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,733
Ooh. Oh, wait. Wait, I see a woman.

251
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,986
Tell me it's his mother.

252
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,822
-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no.

253
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:50,074
Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.

254
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,994
She's walking, she's walking.

255
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:56,747
She's going for the pizza.
Hey, that's not for you, bitch!

256
00:16:01,836 --> 00:16:04,922
<i>Dr. Max to Center 456.</i>

257
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:08,843
<i>Dr. Max to Center 456.</i>

258
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:14,098
Excuse me.
We've been here for over an hour...

259
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,684
...and people less sick than my friend
have gone in.

260
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,937
I mean, that guy with the toe thing?
Who's he sleeping with?

261
00:16:23,274 --> 00:16:26,027
Oh, come on, Dora. Don't be mad.

262
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,738
I know we both said some things...

263
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,407
...we didn't mean...

264
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:34,869
...but that doesn't mean
we still don't love each other.

265
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,997
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

266
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,920
-Lights still out?
-Yeah.

267
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:46,005
Well, maybe they're napping.

268
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:48,966
Heh. Please. They're having sex.

269
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,635
MONICA & PHOEBE:
Shut up.

270
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,268
So, what do you think George is like?

271
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:01,812
-I think he's shy.
-Oh, yeah?

272
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,607
Yeah. I think you have to draw him out.

273
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:08,736
And then when you do,
he's a preppy animal.

274
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,366
Come on.

275
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:16,869
I remember the moonlight coming in
through the open window...

276
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,539
...and her face
had the most incredible glow.

277
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,918
Yes, the moon, the glow,
the magical feeling.

278
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:25,127
You did this part.

279
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:28,339
Could I get some painkillers over here,
please?

280
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:32,760
He's right, enough already.
What is the big deal about today?

281
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,596
So you slept with her for the first time.
So what?

282
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,182
You slept with her
for seven years after that.

283
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:41,811
It's just a little more complicated
than that.

284
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:44,772
What? What is it? That she left you?
That she likes women?

285
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:47,108
That she left you for a woman
that likes women?

286
00:17:47,275 --> 00:17:48,317
A little louder.

287
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:51,654
There's a man on the 12th floor in a coma
who didn't quite hear you.

288
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:56,367
Then what?

289
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,162
My first time with Carol was....

290
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,372
Was my....

291
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,042
What?

292
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:10,381
It was my first...

293
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:11,966
...time.

294
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,844
With Carol?

295
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,975
Oh.

296
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:24,520
So in your whole life,
you've only been with one...?

297
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,938
Oh.

298
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,818
Oh, boy. Hockey was a big mistake.

299
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:34,447
There's a whole bunch of stuff
we could've done tonight.

300
00:18:35,865 --> 00:18:38,242
Okay. Okay, I got one.

301
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:43,539
Do you remember that vegetarian pate
that I made that you loved so much?

302
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,749
Uh-huh.

303
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,253
Well, unless goose is a vegetable....

304
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:52,631
-Oh! Oh!
MONICA & RACHEL: Ha-ha-ha.

305
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:54,342
Okay, fine, fine.

306
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:57,136
Now I don't feel so bad
about sleeping with Jason Hurley.

307
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,390
-What? You slept with Jason?
-You had already broken up.

308
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,060
-How long?
-Just a couple hours.

309
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,228
Oh, that's nice.

310
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,856
Okay, okay, okay, I got one.

311
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,901
Anyway.

312
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:15,780
The valentine Tommy Rollerson left
in your locker was really from me.

313
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,490
Excuse me?

314
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:21,827
Oh, hello?
Like he was really gonna send you one.

315
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,415
She was a big girl.

316
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,126
Really?

317
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:34,590
Well, at least big girls don't pee
in their pants in seventh grade.

318
00:19:34,757 --> 00:19:37,551
I was laughing. You made me laugh.

319
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,346
Oh, my God.
There he is. There he is. There he is.

320
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,974
-Where?
-Right where we've been looking all night.

321
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,103
-Oh, he's so cute.
-Oh, George, baby, drop the towel.

322
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,522
-Come on, drop the towel.
RACHEL & PHOEBE: Drop the towel.

323
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,565
MONICA:
Please drop the towel. Drop it.

324
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,401
ALL:
Wow.

325
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:01,992
Man, can you believe he's only had sex
with one woman?

326
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,412
I think it's great.

327
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:09,041
You know, it's sweet. It's romantic.

328
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:11,085
Really?

329
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:14,422
No, are you kidding?
The guy's a freak. I judge him.

330
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,881
-Hey, man.
-Hey, buddy.

331
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,883
ROSS:
Ah? Ah?

332
00:20:20,428 --> 00:20:21,720
Oh.

333
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,556
That's attractive.

334
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,685
Oh, I thought you were great
in <i>Silence of the Lambs.</i>

335
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:34,400
Oh, come on, admit it,
all things considered, you had fun tonight.

336
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:35,735
Fun? Where was the fun?

337
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,487
Tell me specifically,
which part was the fun part?

338
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,905
Where's my puck?

339
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,867
-Oh. The kid has it.
-The kid?

340
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:46,787
Ahem. Excuse me, uh, that's my puck.

341
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,541
I found it.
Finders keepers, losers weepers.

342
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,088
You gotta do it, man.

343
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,967
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue.
Whatever you-

344
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,219
I can't do it.

345
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,514
-Listen, uh, give me back my puck.
-No.

346
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,724
-Yes, how about?
-No.

347
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,851
-No, come here. Just give me my puck.
-No, no, no.

348
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,978
SIZEMORE:
Hey, no roughhousing in my ER.

349
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,772
Give me my puck! Unh.

350
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,738
Now, that was fun.

351
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,037
ROSS:
Okay, Monica.

352
00:21:28,204 --> 00:21:30,748
Right foot, red.

353
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,376
Could've played Monopoly, but no.

354
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,218
Thanks.

355
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,143
Okay, Pheebs. Right hand, blue.

356
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,190
-Good.
JOEY: Hmm?

357
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,488
Hello?

358
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:06,909
-Oh. Rachel, it's the Visa-card people.
RACHEL: Oh, okay. Will you take my place?

359
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,994
All right. Yes, this is Rachel.

360
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:10,663
RACHEL: No.
-Oh.

361
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:13,958
Hello?

362
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:18,045
Oh, yeah. No, I know.
I haven't been using it much.

363
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:21,757
Oh, well, thanks, but I'm okay, really.

364
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,300
To the green, to the green.

365
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,677
MONICA: Oh, no.
-To the green.

366
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:27,179
I've got magic beans.

367
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:30,975
No, no, never mind.

368
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,560
CHANDLER:
To the left. To the left.

369
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,398
I'm fine.
