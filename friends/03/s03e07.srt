332
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,770
Why don't you tell him about the mole
I haven't gotten checked?

333
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,272
Excellent.

334
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,237
There will come a time
in each of your careers...

335
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:02,491
...when you'll have a chance to screw over
another soap opera actor.

336
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,954
I had such an opportunity
in the recent present.

337
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,459
And I'm ashamed to say...

338
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,252
...that I took it.

339
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:18,633
I advised a fellow actor to play a role...

340
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,552
...homosexually.

341
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,973
Yeah.

342
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:29,560
We both auditioned for the part and, uh...

343
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,980
...as it turned out...

344
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:35,399
...they...

345
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,029
They liked the stupid gay thing
and cast him.

346
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,991
And now...

347
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,078
...he's got a two-year contract...

348
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,581
...opposite Susan Lucci...

349
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,918
...the first lady of daytime television.

350
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:56,170
And me?

351
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,466
Me, I'm stuck here teaching
a bunch of people...

352
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,970
[SOBBING]... most of whom are too ugly
to even be on TV.

353
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,933
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

354
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,319
Thank you.

355
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:26,200
- Uh, may I help you?
- Yes, hi.

I'm the lady who got stuck
with the race-car bed.

Look, it's like I told you.
There's nothing I can do.

358
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:37,837
You signed for it.
"Monica Felula Geller."

359
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,715
All right, jester man, look,
we wanna see the king.

360
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,842
Nobody sees the king.

361
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,928
Okay. I'm talking to the king.

362
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,097
Hey, you can't go back there.

363
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:57,732
Oh, my God.

All right, I'll leave.

My bed's so boring.
