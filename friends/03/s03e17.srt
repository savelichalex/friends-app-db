How hard is it to say "something"?

12

Rachel came over to borrow "something."

13
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:41,248
Anyway, her and Ross just started
yelling at each other.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,918
Why was he yelling at her?
He slept with someone else.

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,421
He says they were on a break
when it happened...

16
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,465
...so she should've
forgiven him by now.

for the people because...

...they needed
to make their hair grow.

when my parents got divorced.

after Cub Scouts.

were still together.

hanging out and happy.

each other much right now.

344
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,285
But please find a way
to be around each other.

345
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,121
And not put us in the middle.

346
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:12,335
Otherwise, I mean, that's just it
for us hanging out together.

347
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,587
Is that what you want?

348
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,132
Can you be civil?

349
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,511
- Yeah.
- I can.

350
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,682
Good, let's get back in the car.
It's freezing...

351
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,726
...and my chest is unsupported.

352
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:30,895
Wait a second.

353
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,940
I mean, what are we doing?
Who's going with who?

354
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,696
Look, you guys should go.

355
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,200
You know,
you planned this all out...

356
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,412
...and I don't wanna ruin it.
So just go.

357
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,706
- You drove all the way up here.
- No, no, no.

358
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,209
I've gotta take
the car back anyway.

359
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,670
I'm spending all day
tomorrow with Ben.

360
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,049
It's fine, okay? Just go.
No guilt, I promise.

361
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,969
Thank you.

MONICA:
We'll call you when we get back.

363
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,060
Maybe we can, like,
go to a movie or something.

364
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,770
Or the rodeo.

365
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,607
- That would be great.
- Okay.

366
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:21,070
I was being Shelley Winters
from The Poseidon Adventure.

367
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,156
I know.

- Ross.
- Hi. Sorry I'm late.

373
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,446
- Were you sleeping?
- Uh, no.

374
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:04,989
Oh, great.

375
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:09,452
I had to get you a new battery.
I got the best I could.

376
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,495
You don't want to skimp there.

377
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,830
You're a genius.

378
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,540
It came to about $112.

379
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:17,168
But what the hell,
call it an even 110?

380
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,629
I'll pay you tomorrow. Bye.

381
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,299
So they, uh, all took off.

382
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,635
It was pretty hard
watching them go, you know?

383
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,471
Yeah, okay. Bye.

So I'm gonna take off then.
