335
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,370
Oh, okay.

336
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,205
There should be a Gold Man.

337
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,418
- Hey.
MONICA: Hey, Rach.

338
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,211
- How was work?
- Oh, great.

339
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:40,381
Although I did sit down
where there wasn't a chair.

340
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,718
By the way, Ross dropped by
a box of your stuff.

341
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:47,221
Oh. Well, I guess I had that one coming.

342
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,392
I'm just gonna throw it out.
It's probably just a bunch of shampoo and...

343
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,145
Something wrong?

344
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,239
Hmm. No. Nothing.

345
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,791
So, uh, what kind of powers
would Gold Man have?

346
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,212
Okay. Well, he would turn things to gold.

347
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,925
- What about things that are already gold?
- Ah. His work is done.

348
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,845
Okay, let's play my game.

349
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,096
Okay.

350
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,975
All right, you yellow-bellied,
lily-livered...

351
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,477
Draw.

352
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,773
Yeah, it's fun.
