I've got picture-in-picture here.</i>

166
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,500
<i>Yeah. Yeah, okay.
I'm gonna have to call you back later.</i>

167
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,295
<i>Monica? You.
I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>

168
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,172
Oh. Oh, okay. Um, so I'll see you soon.

169
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,341
<i>- Okay. I love you.</i>
- I love you.

170
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,885
ALL:
We love you too.

171
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,263
MONICA:
Okay.

172
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,682
Well, it's good news. It's good news.

173
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,060
- So, what do you think the good news is?
JOEY: Look at this.

174
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,565
He wrote a check for $50,000
to Hugo Lindgren's Ring Design.

175
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,861
Oh. Sorry. Uh, what do you think
the good news is?

176
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,656
Oh, my.

177
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,825
Monica's gonna marry a millionaire.

178
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,704
Hey, you gotta get Mom on the phone.
Call Mom. Call Mom.

179
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,706
<i>Hello?</i>

180
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,208
And that's Pete's mom. Ha, ha.

181
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,799
No, Mon, you have to make it
a theme wedding.

182
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,509
And the theme could be:

183
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:38,845
"Look How Much Money We've Got."

184
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,224
You know? I mean, you could put money
in the invitations.

185
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:46,353
You could have, like,
little-money place settings.

186
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,563
And, uh, you could start
with a money salad.

187
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:52,400
I mean, it'll be dry, but people will like it.

188
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:53,902
Would you stop?

189
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:57,364
We've only gone out a couple of weeks.
We don't know if he'll propose.

190
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,116
Yes, but this is Pete, okay?
He's not like other people.

191
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,993
On your first date, he took you to Rome.

192
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:06,164
For most guys, that's like
a third or fourth date kind of thing.

193
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,126
Well, if that's what it is, then it's crazy.

194
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,254
Monica's right. We're talking about
getting married here.

195
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,674
Okay? She can't just rush into this.

196
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,219
Oh, what do you know?
You married a lesbian.

197
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,519
All right. I gotta go.
I have to break up with Vince.

198
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,854
Oh. So you're going with the teacher,
huh?

199
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,858
Yeah. I like Vince a lot, you know?
But Jason is so sensitive, you know?

200
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,445
And in the long run, I think
sensitive is better than having...

201
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,700
...just, like, a really, really,
really nice body.

202
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,205
Jason. Definitely Jason.

203
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,624
- Wish me luck.
ALL: Good luck.

204
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,503
Oh, my God.

205
00:11:56,132 --> 00:12:00,635
Sorry. I was just imagining what it'd be like
to catch the money bouquet.

206
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,852
Excuse me. Um, is Vince here?

207
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,145
Oh, sure.

208
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:11,604
- Vince.
VINCE: Yo.

209
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,819
PHOEBE: Wow. I didn't know you guys
actually used those.

210
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,113
So, what's up?

211
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,489
Um....

212
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,116
Wow.

213
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,744
This isn't gonna be easy. Um....

214
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,873
I don't think we should
see each other anymore.

215
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,499
Uh-huh.

216
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,502
Good deal.

217
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,672
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

218
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:42,719
It's just that, uh, I thought
we had something pretty special here.

219
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:47,098
An you know, I felt like you were someone
I could finally open up to.

220
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,769
There's so much in me
I haven't shared with you yet.

221
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,981
- Oh, my God. I didn't know you were so--
- I'm sorry. I can't talk.

222
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,985

Wait. Wait. Wait.

224
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,205
I'm telling you, if you wanna take care
of that thing, go see my herbal guy.

225
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:15,043
Thank you, but I wanna remove it, Pheebs.
I don't wanna make it savory.

226
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:19,964
You know, when girls sleep with guys
with weird things on their body...

227
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,300
...they tell their friends about it.

228
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,511
Give me that.

229
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:31,392
Hi. Okay, don't be mad at me,
but I couldn't resist.

230
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,727
Bride's magazines?

231
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:35,605
Yes, and I know that you said
you'd say no if he asked you...

232
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,942
...but I'm sorry, how great would you look
walking down the aisle...

233
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,236
...in this Donna Karan?

234
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,322
Oh, you so would.

235
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,115
Oh, you should get that anyway.

236
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,869
Well, for clubbing.

237
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,247
It is so weird.

238
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,583
I know what I said. But, um, this morning...

239
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:59,254
...I was lying in bed, I was imagining
what it'd be like to say yes.

240
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,426
I know it's a little sudden,
and it's rushed...

241
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:08,179
...and it's totally not like me
to do something like this.

242
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,432
But that doesn't mean I can't. Right?

243
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,393
I mean, I'm crazy about Pete.

244
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,145
And I know that we want
the same things.

245
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,815
And when I thought
about saying yes...

246
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,817
...it made me really happy.

247
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:22,777
Oh, my God.

248
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,989
I know.

249
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,866
I need more pie.

250

Hey, Mon, um, if you do get married,
can I bring two guests?

251
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,960
You didn't break up with that fireman?

252
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,045
No, that was my way of telling you.

253
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,632
Well, it turns out
he's incredibly sensitive.

254
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,051
He keeps a journal and he paints.

255
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:49,429
He even showed me charcoal drawings
that he drew of me.

256
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,638
Wow.

257
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,851
He'd prefer watercolors, but, you know,
he has easy access to a lot of charcoal.

258
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,355
So then are you gonna dump Jason?

259
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,817
Well, yeah, because I have to break up
with someone and....

260
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:06,988
Okay, so Jason is sensitive.
But now, so is Vince.

261
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,574
Plus Vince has the body. You know?

262
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:11,159
So....

263
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,371

Hey.

I just was passing by
and saw you were playing.

This is kind of cool,
seeing you up there.

BOTH:
What?

Yeah, okay, I've been dating both of you.

351
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:29,310
And it's been really horrible,
because, you know, it's been...

352
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:31,729
...a lot of fun for me.

353
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,360
