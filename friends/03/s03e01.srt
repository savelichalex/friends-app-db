Dad, what are you doing here?

350
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:49,687
It's your mother's bridge night, so I
came into the city for a Moni-cuddle.

351
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,689
Oh.

352
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,360
Since when did you start
smoking cigars?

353
00:19:57,321 --> 00:20:01,282
I don't.
I just like the smell of them.

354
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,827
So, uh,
what are you really doing here?

355
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,205
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

356
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,625
Why wouldn't I be okay?

357
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,210
I saw Richard.

358
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,171
Oh?

359
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,215
So how you doing?

360
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,799
I'm fine.

- You don't want to know.

363
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,017
No, I really, really do.

364
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,811
Well, he's doing terrible!

Worse than when he broke up
with Barbara.

- You're not just saying that, are you?
- No, the man is a mess!

368
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,661
- Was he crying?
- No.

369
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,539
Do you think he was waiting till
after you left, so he could cry?

370
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:52,416
Maybe.

371
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,544
I think so.

You know, after we graduated from
college, we broke up for a while.

It seems her father,
your grandfather...

375

...wanted her to travel around Europe
like he did.

376

Of course, he got to do it
on Uncle Sam's nickel...

377
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,773

German troop trains at the time.
