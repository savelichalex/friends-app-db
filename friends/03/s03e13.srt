00:00:00,879 --> 00:00:02,374
Hi.

2
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:05,060
Six dollars, please.

3
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,693
Six? I just had it for one night.
It's three.

4
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:11,334
Eight o'clock's the cutoff,
and it's 8:02.

5
00:00:13,007 --> 00:00:15,527
You know, in a weird way,
you have too much power.

6
00:00:16,463 --> 00:00:19,016
You have to help me out here
because I only have three.

7
00:00:19,759 --> 00:00:21,614
I can help with that.

8
00:00:22,639 --> 00:00:25,639
Oh, my God. Richard?

9
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:28,836
- Hi.
- Hi.

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,664
Your lip went bald.

11
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:33,926
Thanks.

12
00:00:36,143 --> 00:00:37,518
You look great!

13
00:00:37,903 --> 00:00:38,831
Right.

14
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,924
No, you do. You just...

15
00:00:42,447 --> 00:00:43,375
What?

16
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:45,639
You got panties stuck to your leg.

17
00:00:49,775 --> 00:00:54,532
That's because I was just grabbing some
things out of the dryer, and static cling.

18
00:00:54,735 --> 00:00:59,176
Or maybe it's because God knew I'd be
running into you and saw an opportunity.

19
00:00:59,887 --> 00:01:00,935
It's good to see you.

20
00:01:01,167 --> 00:01:03,054
It's good to see you too.

21
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:13,645
The One Where Monica and
Richard are Just Friends

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Sync with <font color="ff0000">BoB.720p</font> Version By
<font color="#3b5998">.: TvWorld.ir :.</font>

23
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,502
See that guy?
He's in classics now...

24
00:01:54,703 --> 00:01:58,151
... but as soon as we leave,
he's going straight to the porn.

25
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:02,759
He'll go up to the counter with Citizen
Kane, Vertigo and Clockwork Orgy.

26
00:02:07,215 --> 00:02:09,516
This is nice. I miss this.

27
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,950
- Yeah.
- Me too

28
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,261
So you want to get
a hamburger or something?

29
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,414
I don't know if that's a good idea.

30
00:02:17,639 --> 00:02:20,192
Look, just friends.
I won't grope you. I promise.

31
00:02:21,095 --> 00:02:22,818
I think it's too soon.

32
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,861
No, it's not too soon.
I had lunch at 11:00.

33
00:02:29,447 --> 00:02:30,592
Yeah, baby!

34
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,303
- What are you doing?
- Making chocolate milk. You want some?

35
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:35,909
No, thanks. I'm 29.

36
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:39,136
Oh, my God! I gotta go to work!

37
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,669
What time do you think
you're gonna get off tonight?

38
00:02:41,863 --> 00:02:44,645
- I don't know. It could be really late.
- Come on. Not again!

39
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:48,093
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

40
00:02:48,295 --> 00:02:51,110
For every night that you're asleep
before I get home from work...

41
00:02:51,399 --> 00:02:55,261
... I will wake you up in a way that
has proved very popular in the past.

42
00:02:55,494 --> 00:02:59,073
Well, now if you need to stay late,
I want to be supportive of that.

43
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,652
- Hi.
- Hey.

44
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:05,157
Look at you.
Since when do you rollerblade?

45
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:07,138
Since tomorrow.

46
00:03:07,911 --> 00:03:09,602
I met this really cute guy in the park.

47
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:13,147
And he, like, jogs and blades
and swims, and so we made a deal.

48
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:16,864
He's gonna teach me how
to do all sorts of jock stuff.

49
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:18,685
And what are you gonna do for him?

50
00:03:18,886 --> 00:03:19,966
- I'm gonna let him.
- Okay.

51
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:21,115
Cool.

52
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:23,202
- Good morning.
- Hey.

53
00:03:23,399 --> 00:03:25,471
Somebody got in late last night.

54
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:28,518
Yeah, well, I ran into Richard.

55
00:03:29,063 --> 00:03:30,143
When did this happen?

56
00:03:31,014 --> 00:03:32,869
Around 8:02.

57
00:03:33,831 --> 00:03:37,922
We talked for a little while, and then
we went out for an innocent burger.

58
00:03:38,119 --> 00:03:40,541
There's no such thing as
an innocent burger.

59
00:03:41,351 --> 00:03:43,358
- Are you gonna see him again?
- Tomorrow night.

60
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,314
Monica, what are you doing?

61
00:03:45,575 --> 00:03:47,746
She spent the last six months
getting over him...

62
00:03:47,975 --> 00:03:52,252
... and now she's celebrating that
by going on a date with him.

63
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:55,142
It's not a date, okay?

64
00:03:55,431 --> 00:03:58,878
I'm just gonna teach him how to make a
lasagna for some potluck dinner he has.

65
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,972
You might wanna make extra, because
you'll probably be hungry after the sex.

66
00:04:05,095 --> 00:04:07,004
We're not gonna have sex.

67
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:11,233
Okay, nothing's changed here. He still
doesn't want children, and I still do.

68
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:13,319
So that's why we're gonna
just be friends.

69
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,133
Naked friends.

70
00:04:19,591 --> 00:04:20,605
- Hey.
- Hey.

71
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,142
- Do you have any ice?
- Check the freezer.

72
00:04:23,335 --> 00:04:25,669
If there's none in there,
we're probably out.

73
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,062
Are you just getting home
from work? It's late.

74
00:04:28,262 --> 00:04:30,335
Yeah, I know.
I had the greatest day, though.

75
00:04:30,534 --> 00:04:33,055
I got to sit in on a meeting
with reps from Calvin Klein.

76
00:04:33,766 --> 00:04:37,792
I told my boss I liked this line of lingerie.
She ordered a ton. How was your day?

77
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,337
I discovered I'm able to count all my
teeth using just my tongue.

78
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:50,144
Why do you have a copy of
The Shining in your freezer?

79
00:04:50,502 --> 00:04:53,372
I was reading it last night,
and I got scared, so...

80
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:57,886
But you're safe from it
if it's in the freezer?

81
00:04:58,119 --> 00:04:59,908
Well, safer.

82
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:04,991
I never start reading The Shining without
making sure we got room in the freezer.

83
00:05:06,183 --> 00:05:07,939
How often do you read it?

84
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,916
Haven't you ever read the same book
over and over again?

85
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,471
I read Little Women more than once.

86
00:05:13,671 --> 00:05:15,940
That's a classic. What's so great
about The Shining?

87
00:05:16,135 --> 00:05:19,615
The question should be, Rach, what is
not so great about The Shining?

88
00:05:21,351 --> 00:05:24,417
And the answer would be,
nothing. All right?

89
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:29,121
This is the scariest book ever. I bet it's
way better than that classic of yours.

90
00:05:31,495 --> 00:05:33,382
We'll just see about that, okay?

91
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:39,137
I will read The Shining,
and you will read Little Women.

92
00:05:39,335 --> 00:05:41,058
- All right, you got it.
- All right.

93
00:05:41,607 --> 00:05:44,607
Now, Rach, these little women.

94
00:05:46,215 --> 00:05:47,775
How little are they?

95
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:50,788
I mean, are they, like, scary little?

96
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,390
Chandler, Ross, this is Robert.

97
00:05:58,583 --> 00:05:59,663
- Hey.
- Hi.

98
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:02,100
You have lipstick right here.

99
00:06:02,454 --> 00:06:04,876
That's okay. It's mine.
We just kissed.

100
00:06:05,655 --> 00:06:08,175
So isn't it a bit cold out for shorts?

101
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,707
Well, I'm from California.

102
00:06:11,094 --> 00:06:14,226
Right, right. Sometimes you guys
just burst into flame.

103
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:27,766
I'm up. I'm up. I've gotten up now.

104
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,748
Anybody want anything?

105
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:31,087
- I'll have coffee.
- Me too.

106
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:32,214
Make that three.

107
00:06:32,406 --> 00:06:35,024
Okay, Ross, why don't you come
with me?

108
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,775
What is the matter with you?
What's going on?

109
00:06:41,974 --> 00:06:43,698
Robert's coming out.

110
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:46,031
What do you mean?
What? Is he gay?

111
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,999
He's coming out of his shorts.

112
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,972
What?

113
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:00,753
The man is showing brain.

114
00:07:04,887 --> 00:07:08,149
Are you sure? Hold on.

115
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:11,215
I'm sorry, you guys.
That was a coffee and a...

116
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:12,821
Coffee. We could write it down.

117
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:16,209
No, no, that won't be necessary.

118
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:25,649
- Well?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:28,781
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Well, I suppose we just...

120
00:07:28,983 --> 00:07:32,660
... try to not look directly at it.

121
00:07:33,846 --> 00:07:35,756
Like an eclipse.

122
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:42,517
When people compliment me on my
cooking tonight, what do I say?

123
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,322
You say, "Thank you very much. "
And then you buy me something pretty.

124
00:07:46,615 --> 00:07:49,036
Come on, we're gonna
put our hands in this bowl...

125
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,986
... and we're gonna start
squishing the tomatoes.

126
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:55,952
This feels very weird.

127
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,930
You touch people's eyeballs,
and this feels weird?

128
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:03,957
Sure, I touch them, but I spent years
learning not to squish them.

129
00:08:09,526 --> 00:08:11,152
That's my hand.

130
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,581
- Gotta keep squishing.
- The tomatoes are squishing.

131
00:08:19,798 --> 00:08:21,621
You got some on your shirt.

132
00:08:21,814 --> 00:08:23,375
Hold on one second.

133
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:27,661
Just put a little club soda on it.
Get to it right away.

134
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:30,709
It should do...

135
00:08:31,831 --> 00:08:33,424
... the trick.

136
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:44,207
What?

137
00:08:44,406 --> 00:08:45,683
You've got some on your pants.

138
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,998
I'll just throw them out.

139
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:59,329
These little women!

140
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:03,434
You're liking it?

141
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:06,942
Oh, yeah.
Amy just burned Jo's manuscript.

142
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:09,187
I don't see how he could forgive her.

143
00:09:12,234 --> 00:09:15,169
Jo's a girl.
It's short for Josephine.

144
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:18,338
But Jo's got a crush on Laurie.

145
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,602
You mean it's like a girl-girl thing?

146
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,517
Because that is the one thing missing
from The Shining.

147
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,345
No, actually, Laurie's a boy.

148
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:37,668
No wonder Rachel had to read this
so many times.

149
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:41,289
- Hey.
- Hey.

150
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:43,206
How'd the basketball go?

151
00:09:43,402 --> 00:09:48,192
I learned how to shoot a lay-up,
a foul shot, and a 23-pointer.

152
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:49,762
You mean a 3-pointer?

153
00:09:49,995 --> 00:09:52,362
I get more because I'm dainty.

154
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:56,257
So is there a phone here
I check my messages?

155
00:09:56,523 --> 00:09:58,279
Yeah, in the back.
Do you want a quarter?

156
00:09:58,474 --> 00:10:01,671
No, thanks. I always carry one
in my sock.

157
00:10:12,522 --> 00:10:14,911
What are you doing?
Get back over on your side of the...

158
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,187
Hello!

159
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:22,980
Hi, I'm Joey. We haven't met.

160
00:10:23,178 --> 00:10:24,967
Good to meet you. Robert.

161
00:10:28,714 --> 00:10:29,794
What?

162
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:33,700
What? You guys, what is going on?

163
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:36,419
Do you not like Robert?

164
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:37,926
Why are you laughing?

165
00:10:38,122 --> 00:10:40,032
Calm down.
There's no reason to get testy.

166
00:10:45,642 --> 00:10:48,009
- You guys! Come on!
- We're sorry.

167
00:10:48,203 --> 00:10:53,767
We're sorry. It just seems that Robert
isn't as concealed in the shorts area...

168
00:10:53,963 --> 00:10:55,337
... as one may have hoped.

169
00:10:56,618 --> 00:10:57,796
What do you mean?

170
00:10:57,994 --> 00:11:00,744
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:11:00,939 --> 00:11:05,478
Robert, could you pass me
those cookies?

172
00:11:05,995 --> 00:11:07,588
Sure.

173
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:14,024
So how'd the lasagna go over?

174
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:18,536
Really? Good. So you owe me
three pretty things.

175
00:11:19,698 --> 00:11:22,317
Yeah, I've been thinking a lot
about you too.

176
00:11:23,186 --> 00:11:26,699
Well, no. It's hard,
this platonomy thing.

177
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,551
It's a word.

178
00:11:32,178 --> 00:11:34,764
Yeah, I do think it's better this way.

179
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:36,489
Yeah, we're being smart.

180
00:11:36,787 --> 00:11:38,674
Yes, I'm sure.

181
00:11:40,786 --> 00:11:42,673
You really sure?

182
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:45,805
I'll call you back.

183
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:57,607
So we can be friends
who sleep together.

184
00:11:58,571 --> 00:12:01,385
Absolutely. This'll just be
something we do.

185
00:12:01,611 --> 00:12:04,131
Like racquetball.

186
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:07,235
Sounds smart and healthy to me.

187
00:12:08,586 --> 00:12:12,448
So just out of curiosity...

188
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:16,062
... do you currently have
any other racquetball buddies?

189
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,170
Just your dad.

190
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:23,264
Although that's actually racquetball.

191
00:12:23,466 --> 00:12:26,849
You know, I do have a blind date...

192
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,050
... with my sister's neighbor
next Tuesday.

193
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,632
Do you want me to cancel it?

194
00:12:35,114 --> 00:12:36,521
No!

195
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:43,138
No, because if you did,
that means you'd be canceling for me.

196
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,338
- And we're just friends.
- Exactly.

197
00:12:50,174 --> 00:12:51,102
Hey.

198
00:12:51,295 --> 00:12:52,985
Hey. Don't sit down!

199
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:57,306
- Ready to go to the batting cage?
- Yeah, you bet. And first, here's a gift.

200
00:13:01,503 --> 00:13:03,542
Stretchy pants?

201
00:13:03,742 --> 00:13:05,597
Those are the greatest things
in the world!

202
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,246
If I were you, I'd wear them
every day, every day!

203
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:12,379
Jeez, thank you.
Really, that's so nice.

204
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:16,764
But, to be honest,
I don't think I can wear these.

205
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:20,057
They're so tight.
I'd feel like I'm on display.

206
00:13:22,046 --> 00:13:23,159
I'm sorry.

207
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:25,944
That's all right. I'll figure...

208
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:30,266
Hey.

209
00:13:30,462 --> 00:13:32,284
- How's it going?
- Good.

210
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,519
Hey, Rach, how you doing
with The Shining?

211
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,148
Danny just went into room 217.

212
00:13:37,406 --> 00:13:40,854
The next part's the best!
When that dead lady in the bathtub...

213
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,356
No! Come on, you're gonna ruin it!

214
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,717
All right, I'll talk in code.

215
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:49,214
Remember when the kid sees
those two blanks in the hallway?

216
00:13:50,174 --> 00:13:51,701
Yeah, that's very cool.

217
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:56,211
All blank and no blank makes
blank a blank-blank.

218
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,684
No, the end! When Jack almost kills
them all with that blank...

219
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:03,674
... but in the last
second they get away.

220
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,765
Joey, I can't believe
you just did that.

221
00:14:07,966 --> 00:14:10,683
I can't believe she cracked your code.

222
00:14:15,358 --> 00:14:18,741
All right. Okay. Laurie proposes
to Jo, and she says no...

223
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:23,413
... even though she's still in love with
him. And then he ends up marrying Amy.

224
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:28,378
Hey, mine was by accident!

225
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:33,211
All right. The boiler explodes and
destroys the hotel and kills the dad.

226
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,655
Beth dies.

227
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,293
Beth... Beth dies?

228
00:14:48,702 --> 00:14:52,347
Is that true?
If I keep reading, is Beth gonna die?

229
00:14:52,734 --> 00:14:55,800
No, Beth doesn't die.
She doesn't die. Does she, Rachel?

230
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:58,103
- What?
- Joey's asking if you've ruined...

231
00:14:58,334 --> 00:15:01,596
... the first book he's ever loved
that didn't star Jack Nicholson.

232
00:15:05,246 --> 00:15:08,093
No. She doesn't die.

233
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,073
Then why would you say that?

234
00:15:13,982 --> 00:15:17,779
Because I wanted to hurt you.

235
00:15:19,358 --> 00:15:21,911
There they are.
I dropped my keys.

236
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:25,915
Got them.

237
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:31,925
Hi.

238
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,775
Sorry. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,979
You would not believe my day.

240
00:15:37,406 --> 00:15:40,789
I had to work two shifts.
And then to top it off...

241
00:15:41,086 --> 00:15:45,047
... I lost one of my fake boobs
in a grill fire.

242
00:15:48,318 --> 00:15:49,725
What are you smiling at?

243
00:15:49,918 --> 00:15:52,089
I was just thinking your day
could still pick up.

244
00:15:58,078 --> 00:15:59,507
Hello.

245
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,044
I love this friend thing!

246
00:16:08,766 --> 00:16:12,759
Robert's gonna be here any second,
so could one of you just tell him?

247
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:14,390
Please, right now.

248
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:18,387
Every time I see him, it's like,
"Is it on the loose? Is it watching me?"

249
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:21,053
We can't tell him.

250
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:26,581
You can't go up to a guy you barely
know and talk about his stuff.

251
00:16:26,782 --> 00:16:30,841
He's right. Even if it's
to say something complimentary.

252
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,952
- Hey.
- Hey.

253
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:36,234
So you ready for the gym?

254
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:40,366
They got this new rock-climbing wall.
We can spot each other.

255
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:43,568
Yeah, I can spot you from here.

256
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,537
What?

257
00:16:48,946 --> 00:16:51,248
Okay, listen, Robert...

258
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:54,796
- Hey, don't we have to... ?
- Yeah, we got...

259
00:17:01,714 --> 00:17:06,570
- I think you're really, really great.
- Oh, God. Here we go again.

260
00:17:06,866 --> 00:17:11,089
Why does this keep happening to me?
Is it something I'm putting out there?

261
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:16,682
Is this my fault? Or am I just nuts?

262
00:17:19,762 --> 00:17:22,096
I don't know what to say.

263
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:27,889
Hey, buddy? This is a family place.
Put the mouse back in the house.

264
00:17:50,258 --> 00:17:54,382
Really? It's just like
everyone else's apartment.

265
00:17:54,578 --> 00:17:56,334
It's got rooms and walls
and ceilings.

266
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,864
I just wanted to see where you live.
Give me the tour.

267
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,360
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

268
00:18:01,682 --> 00:18:03,951
- This is the living room.
- That's nice.

269
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,184
And this is the kitchen.

270
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:09,517
That's real pretty. Wait a minute.
Don't I get to see the bedroom?

271
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,608
The bedroom. Well, it's pretty much
your typical...

272
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,776
... bedroom.

273
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:20,782
We're still on this side of the door.
But I didn't get to see it.

274
00:18:21,042 --> 00:18:23,660
Oh, shoot. Maybe next time.

275
00:18:23,858 --> 00:18:25,483
Thanks for a lovely evening.

276
00:18:42,706 --> 00:18:44,396
So who is she?

277
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:47,983
That was the blind date
that I told you about.

278
00:18:48,178 --> 00:18:51,178
She called and switched it
from Tuesday.

279
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,253
Did you like her?

280
00:18:54,482 --> 00:18:59,500
I'm just asking as a friend
because I am totally fine with this.

281
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:03,180
Well, you seem fine.

282
00:19:03,922 --> 00:19:06,889
Okay, you know what?
I'm not fine. I'm not.

283
00:19:07,154 --> 00:19:10,699
I mean, how could I be fine?
Hearing you come in with her.

284
00:19:10,962 --> 00:19:13,809
She wants to see your bedroom.

285
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,312
You know what?

286
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,057
What if we're friends...

287
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,720
... who don't see other people?

288
00:19:31,282 --> 00:19:33,137
You mean like exclusive friends?

289
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,573
Why not?

290
00:19:35,474 --> 00:19:38,823
I mean, this has been
the most amazing week.

291
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:41,900
Would it be so terrible?

292
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:46,664
Even if we were friends
who lived together?

293
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:53,192
Or maybe someday, friends who stood
up in front of their other friends...

294
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,840
... and vowed to be friends forever.

295
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:04,749
You know, we're back where we were.

296
00:20:06,450 --> 00:20:11,371
Honey, I would love to do all that,
but nothing's changed.

297
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,242
That's not true.
You don't have a mustache.

298
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:19,688
Okay, one thing's changed.

299
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:23,529
But we still want different things,
and we know how this is gonna end.

300
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:25,999
You know what?

301
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:29,197
I gotta walk out of here right now...

302
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:34,190
... because getting over you is the
hardest thing I have ever had to do.

303
00:20:36,114 --> 00:20:38,056
I don't think I could do it again.

304
00:20:38,994 --> 00:20:41,416
I know I couldn't.

305
00:20:42,578 --> 00:20:44,400
Yeah.

306
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,272
So...

307
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,511
How about one last
game of racquetball?

308
00:21:03,826 --> 00:21:05,768
Watch the thorns!

309
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,027
What?

310
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,839
Beth is really, really sick.

311
00:21:22,161 --> 00:21:26,090
Jo's there, but I don't think
there's anything she can do.

312
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,671
- Joey?
- Yeah.

313
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:33,287
You wanna put the book
in the freezer?
