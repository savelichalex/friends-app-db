00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:03,516
Look, the only one who stands to get hurt
is me, and I'm okay with that.

333
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,352
Yeah, you may be okay
with getting hurt...

334
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,730
...but I am not okay with being
the one who hurts you.

335
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:14,777
- That's why I can't take this job.
- What?

336
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:18,698
Well, we probably shouldn't
see each other anymore.

337
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,075
I'm sorry.

338
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,452
Okay. Yeah.

339
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:27,790
I mean, if that's really what you want,
okay.

340
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,587
Okay. Bye.

341
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:39,468
I'm sorry things didn't work out...

342
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:43,931
Shut up for a second
and let me just see something.

343
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,938
Oh, wow.

344
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,280
Okay, you'd tell me the truth, right?

345
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:03,201
- Rach, you can't look fat in an x-ray.
- Okay.

346
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:09,248
Hey, now, you stay out here
and you think about what you did.

347
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,628
- That's a duck.
- That's a bad duck.

348
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:20,218
- How'd the thing go tonight, Ross?
- Oh, it was... No, no.

349
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,469
What thing? What thing?

350
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:24,263
Nothing. There was this thing
at the museum. Come on.

351
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,557
Easy.

352
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,518
Okay, now, when you come back...

353
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,480
...I hope you remember
that that chick is not a toy.

[QUACKING]

355
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,277
What thing? What is this thing?

356
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:43,157
Aw, I was kind of supposed to be on TV
tonight for the Discovery Channel.

357
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,660
Oh, my God.

358
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,578
Ross, why didn't you tell me that?

359
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,539
Ah, I knew that if I told you,
you'd make me go...

360
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:54,835
...and I knew you needed someone
to be with you tonight. Come on.

361
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,213
- Come on.
- I cannot believe you.

362
00:20:57,381 --> 00:21:00,967
- What?
- That is the sweetest thing.

363
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,062
You should get some sleep.

364
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,147
Okay.

365
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,775
- So I'll, um...
- I'm sorry I spoiled your evening.

366
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:20,361
No, that's... No, as long as you're okay.

367
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:23,489
So I'll, uh... I'll see you tomorrow.

368
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,449
Mm-hm. Yeah.

369
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,874
See you.

370
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,930
What did you do?

371
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,525
JOEY:
What you doing?

372
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,736
Having a swim.

373
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:03,904
What about the chick?

374
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,906
Chicks don't swim.

375
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,700
Are you sure?

376
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,078
I don't know.

377
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:14,915
- Should we try?
- Sure.

378
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:24,800
See, I told you. They don't swim.

379
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:28,304
- Well, give him a minute.
- No.

380
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:33,059
Oh, it's okay. It's okay, baby, baby, baby.
